# WordPress Template Structure

The WordPress template structure is pretty straight forward. If I would I have to break it up I would do so into 5 different sections.

## The header

The header is the top region of your site which maps directly to the top piece of your code. WordPress gives a function call for this which we will go over later. Inside the header you have the doctype, header tags, styles and some other function calls

## The navigation

This call for the navigation can also either live in the header section and/or the main section area. This would just depend on how your theme is structured. It does not warrant it's own file but sometimes it is nicer to keep it separate.

## The main section

The main section is what I would call the meat of the site. The area where the actual content shows through. Because WordPress offers different types of files this section can live in several different files.

## The sidebar

The sidebar is, well you guessed, the sidebar. This file can sit on either the left side of the site and/or the right side of the site. Not all templates require this file but it is one of the main files for the template structure.

## The footer

Last but not least every template could have a footer that will sit at the bottom of the site and carry any additional information needed for your site.

# Conclusion

Thank you for taking the WordPress Theme Creation course. In this course we went through the ins and outs of creating your own WordPress theme. We hope that now you have a great understanding of how to create your theme or at least have a starting point that you can then springboard forward.

There is so much to WordPress and being that it powers a good amount of the web today, it will be around for while so be sure you know how to modify it.

Happy Theming!

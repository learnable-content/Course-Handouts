# Set the home page

Remebering again that WordPress was a blog first system we have to go to the admin area to change our site so it serves up a front page first before showing a blog.

In the admin area you can do this by going to `Settings > Reading` and set which page inside your dashboard you would like as your home page.

Select "A static page" and the drop down will allow you to select a page for the home page.

## front-page.php

Now we already added a `front-page.php` file from earlier we just need to make sure it looks like the front page from our template. Remember by doing this our front page will and can look entirely different from any of the other pages we have listed. The front page is what your site visitors will see first so make sure it shows off everything you are wanting it to show off.

# The 404 Page

Whenever there is a url that is entered and there is not a page created for it then WordPress or any page for that matter a 404 not found page will be served. Over the years there have been a great deal of creative 404 pages that have been created. If you see here [Creative 404 Pages](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/best-404-pages-812505) you can have a log of fun with this template. 

The cool thing about this too is you really don't have to pass any data to it as well so it could have an entirely different look.

All you need to do to take advantage of this part of WordPress is create file called `404.php`. After this file is created you can then start developing what you need for your missing pages. You can even provide a way for the user to search the database for something they were look for.

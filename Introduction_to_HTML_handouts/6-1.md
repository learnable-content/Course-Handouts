# Conclusion

You've come to the end of this course. Thanks you for your attention and patience!

HTML is a very important subject for anyone who wants to work more closely with website coding. We have overviewed the main concepts of the HTML and its role in today's web. With what you have learned here you can already start crafting better HTML pages. Remember to use HTML only to structure and define content semantically and leave the presentation of your website to CSS. Test and validate your code and always follow the best practices like we did in this course.

I hope that you have learned something new and that this knowledge will be useful in your future projects. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Until next time!

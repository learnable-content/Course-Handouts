# Introduction

At this step we are going to talk about **Agile** project management.

# Overview of Agile project management

This graph shows you the overview of Agile project management. There's a **test**, **release**, **design**, **build** and **configure** cycle that just goes over and over again.

Agile officially started at 2001 with the Agile Manifesto. Agile comes from the realm of software development, so, it's very much defined by that. Agile Manifesto focused on changing the relationships between developers, managers and customers.

The idea behind Agile is that you're completing a small portion of the project in each cycle as compared to a full version of the project like with Lean, for example. Then you get feedback and modify the overall project course. There is some overlap with the Lean and iterative methods. Actually, Agile is a variant of an iterative method. The main is that Agile methods complete the small portions of deliverables, where the iterative methods complete the whole version each time. Suppose, you are creating a web site. With Agile you would, for example, firstly complete the banner, then the sidebar and so on. You wouldn't be delivering a whole website at a time and then getting feedback and then modifying the whole website.

# Pros and cons of Agile

Agile is a step up from Waterfall methodology, which we're going to talk about later.

One of the big pros of Agile is **getting feedback** as you develop. You create something that meets your current customer needs with minimal costs, waste and time involved.

For example, suppose you make an assumption in step one of the product development and then you complete like a mockup or a version of the product based on an assumption that you made. Then it turns out that assumption was wrong. In this case you would have to go back and redo everything starting from step one. Agile tries to overcome this problem. You basically test your assumptions at every step with different parts of the deliverables. It saves money and time.

# How Agile applies to freelance work?

Agile is used on many software development teams, so it's really good to know at least the basics of this methodology. Some of the bigger teams also use a combination of Agile and Scrum or Lean.

As a freelancer you probably can't base your whole workflow on Agile, but you can pull little pieces from them. One of the things that you can learn from Agile is that you don't want to go off in a cave and create a whole project without getting any feedback along the way. This seems obvious, but it can be overlooked just because the client might not request constant check-ins. We're going to talk more about managing feedback later, because getting too much feedback can cause a whole other set of issues.

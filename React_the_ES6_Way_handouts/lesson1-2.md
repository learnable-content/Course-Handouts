# The Tools of the Trade

## Text Editor

The very first thing you'll need is a text editor. Hopefully, you already have a favourite and you're using it. These days I prefer Vim, but to each their own. Here are some popular choices:

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

If you prefer a full blown IDE, [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
is a good choice, though it will cost you some money.

## Browser

You can use whatever web browser you choose, but I highly recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome. Google Chrome has a great set of developer tools for React, and we will be using them throughout the course to help us debug and gain some insight as to what is happening in the browser when React renders the components in the DOM.

## GitHub

We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store our code, so if you're not familiar with it, you can find a great general overview of it [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). I'll be using the command line in the tutorials, but if that's not your thing go ahead and use whichever git client you'd like. Some popular ones are:

* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

You'll also need to ensure that Git is installed on your system. If you are running OS X or Linux, then you've already got it so don't sweat it. If you're on Windows there is a great solution out there called [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/). After installation you'll have Git installed, as well as a GUI Git client, *and* Git BASH -- a handy terminal emulator providing a *NIX command-line interface including the `git` command.

## The *Dreaded* Command Line

Yes, we will be doing some work on the command line. But don't worry, you don't have to be a Linux SysAdmin to get by here. We'll be using just a few very simple commands to get our code transpiled, and to start our Node servers. If you're using OS X or Linux, congratulations, you already have
a great bash terminal installed on your system. If you're using Windows, you can certainly use the run of the mill MS-DOS prompt, or you can use Git BASH, which will be installed if you used the link from above.

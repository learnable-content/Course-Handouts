Introduction

So let's go ahead and get set up sowe can start writing some ES2015 code.The specification was ratified in June of 2015 andis currently being implemented in browsers.In this course we'll be covering new features.Such as, parameter destructuring, template strings, arrow functions, and classes.Some of these new features are additions to the core of the ECMAScript,while others, such as classes, just provide some syntactic sugaron top of old functionality, just to make things easier to code.Because support for all of the features has not yet been adopted,we will have to install just a few tools to get going with ES2015.We'll be using the Babel CLI to run the Node REPL andreally, that is about all we will need to get started.So let's go ahead and get set up so we can start writing some ES2015 code.

Making a Receipt Totaler

So far in this lesson, we have learned some great new ES2015features that have everything to do with parameter handling.Let's write a little bit of code sothat we can see how this might help us in the real world.In our last lesson, we created a receipt calculator that took a list of items, anda tax rate and calculated the subtotal and total tax for all of the items.Let's open that back up in the Node REPL andsee what happens if we omit the tax rate variable from our function.Uhâ€“oh, what happened there?Unfortunately, because we we're using positional arguments here,we can't omit the first tax rate variable and also include the items variable.When we omit the tax rate variable, the items variable now becomes the tax rate.But this doesn't make having default values forparameters very useful now, does it?We can get around this by using a JavaScript object in the functionalong with some crafty destructuring assignment.We're also going to modify our calculate tax function in the math moduleto use this feature.Let's take a look.Now we just need to change the way we call the function in the REPL.Awesome.We were able to fix our problem using destructuring andenhanced parameter handling.If you were wondering about that function call that we just did,using our new found ES2015 superpowers, we're able to not only destructureobjects using that syntax but we can also structure objects using the same syntax.What you see above, is exactly the same as this.Because our variable name is the same as the name of the key we want in the object,we can assign it this way, it's just a convenient shorthand.We've learnt a great deal in this lesson about all the great new ways tohandle parameters, variables, and objects using ES2015.Let's move on, and see how template strings can make our lives even easier.

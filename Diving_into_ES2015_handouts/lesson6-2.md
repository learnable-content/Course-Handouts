Making a Receipt Printer

Now that we know about template literals let's put them to use andcreate a function that will print out a receipt of all our items.We're going to use the 'strip' function from the last lessonto create this receipt.So let's go ahead and make a new file called 'utils-strings.js'.Input the 'strip' function in there.Okay, great.Now it's as simple as importing the modules we needin creating a function that will print out a receipt.Let's create another new file called 'printer.js' and create our function.That's it, so what's happening here?The first thing we did was calculate the total price andtotal tax using our 'calculate' function andassign the values to total and total tax variables using destructuring.Then we used our custom template literal called 'strip' to print out our receipt.We also snuck in another new ES2015 feature, the 'string.prototype.repeat'.It does exactly what you think it does,repeating the string the number of times you specify in the argument.Let's go ahead and save this file and try it out in the console.Great, it works.Template literals are awesome.Let's move on now and learn all about ES2015 classes.

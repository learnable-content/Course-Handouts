Getters, Setters, and Base Class Access

A couple of interesting things that we can do with classes is defining getters andsetters.It looks something like this.This is a pretty simple concept and allows us to have some control over the innerworkings of our class at the instance level.Let's open up the REPL and take a look at it in action.Cool.Now let's check out how we can access the superclass when using inheritance.Imagine we have the 'Truck' class from the last lesson andwe want to add the 'drive' variable to the 'print' method.We can do that prettyeasily just like this.What we did there was access the superclass using the 'super' keyword andthen called the 'print' method from the superclass.We use string interpolation to add this to a new string that includeswhether the vehicle is two wheel drive or four wheel drive.Now that's pretty cool.We're moving right along.Let's go ahead and finish up by talking about how to use static members.

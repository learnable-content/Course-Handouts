Static Members

The last thing we're going to talk about with regards to classes is static members.Static members allow you to create methods on a class that are notbound to any instance of the class.Let's take a look at a 'Rectangle' class, for instance.Now this is interesting.Let's go ahead and save this and open it up in the REPL so we can see it in action.So as you can see we were able to call the 'square' method on the 'Rectangle' classwithout creating a new instance of it.This is useful for situations like we showed above, and also just forwrapping up code that is relevant to a specific class, butdoesn't rely on any instance properties of the class to be useful.And that's it for classes, and that's it for the Diving into ES2015 course.Thanks for joining me, and you are now ready to dive in to ES2015 anduse all of the great new features it has to offer.

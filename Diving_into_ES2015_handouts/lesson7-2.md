Class Definition

Let's discuss how to define classes and how ES 2015 introduces class inheritance.Defining a class is a very simple thing to do, it can be just as simple as this.Of course, this class doesn't do much andwe can't initialize it with anything useful.So let's go ahead and add a constructor.Okay, great.So what we've done here is simply set the variable names that are passed inwhen creating an instance of the class on this.You can create an instance of this class by using the 'new' keyword.That's great but it's still not very useful.One thing we can do is add a method to the class,that makes it just a bit more useful.We made this class a bit more useful by adding a function that can be accessedfrom the instance of the class.Great.
Inheritance

Now ES2015 introduces class inheritance along with the 'class' keyword.With inheritance, you can make a class extend another class andthus inheriting all of its properties.Let's take a look at how that works.What you see here,is that we've created a new class called 'Truck' that inherits from 'Vehicle'.The 'Vehicle' class here, is known as the base class.It is called the base class because it does not inherit from any other class.Conversely when referring to the 'Vehicle' class from the perspective of the 'Truck'class, it is known as the superclass.It is the prototype of the 'Truck' class.Let's look at this in the REPL.You can see here that the prototype of the 'Truck' class is the 'Vehicle' class.'Vehicle' is the superclass of 'Truck'.The 'Truck' class will act in the same way as a 'Vehicle' class butrequires one extra parameter during initialization.You'll notice that in the constructor of the 'Truck' class,I used the 'super' keyword.What this does is invoke the parent class' constructor methodwith the variables you pass into it.Now that we know how to create a class, let's go ahead andconvert all the code we have been writing for our tax calculator andreceipt printer over to a class based module.Let's open up the 'calculator.js' file andreplace the whole thing with our brand new class.Cool.So now we can save this file and open up the REPL and use it like this.Cool.Now we've wrapped up all of that functionality into a single class.Now that's it for definitions and inheritance.Let's move on and see how we can use getters, setters andaccess the base class.

Arrow Functions Everywhere

So far in this lesson we have learned a bit about how arrow functions work.Let's write a little bit of code sothat we can see how this might help us in the real world.We're going to create a receipt calculator function that leverages this feature.Let's go ahead and move into the directory that we established in the first lesson,where we're going to hold all of our code for this tutorial, andcreate a file called 'calculator.js'.Once this is created, go ahead and open it in your favorite text editor.Let's start by defining some sample data that we can export foreasy testing in the console.Great.We've set up a simple data structure herethat holds a list of items that somebody is purchasing.Each of these items includes the cost of the item, and whether ornot the item is taxable.Next go ahead and start creating our function.Let's just start with the shell of the function.Now we've got a basic function but unfortunately it doesn't do anything.Let's start by adding some parameters.There's a few things this function will need to know in order to be useful.The first thing it's going to need to know is the rate at which to apply tax toa particular item.Okay, great, but we're going to need more.We also need to have a list of items to iterate throughin order to calculate the total.Let's add that as the items parameter.Awesome.Now we've got a function that takes two arguments.Let's write the meat of this function now.Okay that looks like it will work but I think we should leverage the math modulethat we created in the last lesson to make this easier.Let's import it and put it to work.Okay, now it's imported andwe can go ahead and use it.Great, we've now got a function that we can use to calculate a totalfrom a list of items.Let's go ahead and save our file and exit and then we can fire up the Node REPL andtry it out.Cool, it works.
Moving On

We're learning a lot about ES2015, but we're not done yet.Let's move on to the next lesson where we'll talk about parameter handling anddestructuring.

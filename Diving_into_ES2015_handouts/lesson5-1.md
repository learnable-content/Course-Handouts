Parameter Handling

ES2015 comes with a brand new way to assign variableswhen dealing with arrays and objects.This new feature is called destructuring assignment, and it allows you to easily
Default Parameter Values

assign variables from array elements or key value pairs for an object.Let's dive right in, shall we?The first type of destructuring we're going to talk about is array matching.Put simply, this feature allows you to assign a list of variables formatching indices in arrays.Let's take a look at this code example, so that we can better see how this works.
Rest Parameters

As you can see here we were able to easily assigned to three variables a b andc, the values that matched on the indices of the array.If we want to only match on some of our indices,we can use the spread operator, like this.It's also possible to skip an index when doing this type of assignment.
Spread Operator

It's as easy as just not passing in a new variable name at the index that you wouldlike to skip, and the variable won't be assigned.Another great destructuring assignment that is now available to us,is object matching.With object matching we can assign variables in much the sameway that we did using array matching.But in this case, we will be matching our variable names to the object keys,instead of array indices.As you can see, the syntax differs slightly here,in that we're using curly braces for the destructuring assignment,to match the fact that we're destructuring on an object.This works equally as well for deeply nested objects.Now you can very easily extract a value from a deeply nested object using thisnew destructuring assignment.This is a great new feature.We can use these same types of assignments in functions.Using parameter context matching, we can use this sametype of destructuring assignments syntax in the definition of function parameters.Let's take a look at this following example.In this example the 'print' function is expecting to receive asan argument an object with the key of value.You can also extend this to work in various ways.What we did here was pass in a predefined object that fits whatthe function is looking for.But what if we had a variable named 'value' thatalready contains the value that we want to print.ES2015 has something for that too.That's really powerful and flexible.This allows you to write a lot less code and to easily refactor existing code.You might think that this is all been really amazing, but we're not done yet.There's one more great feature, andit really puts the cherry on top of everything that we have covered so far.It's called fail soft destructuring.When attempting to assign a variable via destructuring if the index or object keydoes not exist, that variable will simply be undefined instead of throwing an error.That's not all though.We can also assign a default value if we want.Let's see this in action.And this also works for objects.Awesome, this is going to make variable assignment a breeze.This is been a great introduction to destructuring assignments in ES2015,but let's keep moving and see what we can learn next.

How To Use Modules

In the last lesson we ran through all the different ways to import andexport modules.How and why do we put this to use?Because JavaScript has never had a built in module system,we tend to see a lot of code out in the wild.That is just a whole bunch of unrelated code thrown together into a huge file.Granted this is not true for every case, butit's good practice to keep your code self contained in small pieces.This helps immensely with maintenance, readability, and reusability.Let's take a quick look at how this can help usby looking at some of the code that we created in the last lesson.in that lesson we created some simple math functions for exporting.Let's create something a little more useful this time.First, make sure you're in the directory where we previously installed Babel, node,and the presets module, and then let's create a file called 'math.js'.Now let's create a function that will calculate the total amount that an itemon a receipt will cost with or without tax.Great! This is just a simple function that takesin a price, a tax rate, anda boolean that determines if the item is taxable; pretty simple.Now that we've created this model let's see how we can use it.Let's go ahead and exit out and save our file and fire up the Node REPL.See how easy that was?Now any time we would like to use this function we can simply requireit wherever we need it.Unfortunately, we can't use the import statement in the REPL, but if we were toimport this module using ES2015 syntax in another module, it would look like this.
Moving on

We've come a long way already.Let's move on and learn all about their variables and scoping.

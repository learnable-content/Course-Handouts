Sass brings a lot more power to CSS and starts to make it feel like a real programming language rather than just a series of property and value declarations. One key feature that enables this programmatic field is **Sass variables** which can hold a number of different types of data.

In this episode, you'll learn the seven core data types in Sass, and how we can manipulate and operate on these various values. Sass variables can store a number of different data types, including numbers, strings, colors, booleans, nulls, lists and maps. These different data types allows to create variables for all sorts of different CSS values.

A variable is just a handy label for some arbitrary value, and they can help make our code easier to read and quicker to update. Let's look at each of these different data types in turn to clarify what they are, how to use them and the kinds of values that we can put inside each of them.

Sass variables can store a number of different data types including:

* numbers
* strings
* colors
* booleans
* nulls
* lists
* and maps

These different data types allow us to create variables for all sorts of
different CSS values. A variable is just a handy label for an arbitrary
value and they can help make our code easier to read and quick to update.

Let's look at each of the different data types in turn to clarify what
they are and how to use them.


### Numbers

Numbers are used a lot in CSS from setting margins and font-sizes to
border-radius and line height. Numbers come in a few different flavours
including integers (whole numbers), floating points (decimals) and length
values like `10px`, `20em` or `50%`.

{% highlight scss %}
1, 2, 3, 0.1, 5.3, 10px, 20em, 50%
{% endhighlight %}

### Strings

Strings of text are found in a number of CSS values including font
families, colours and URLs. String in CSS are found both with and
without surrounding quotation marks and are said to be "quoted" or
unquoted strings. 

{% highlight scss %}
"Times New Roman", '../images/logo.png', red, sans-serif
{% endhighlight %}

Sass (just like CSS) doesn't differentiate between strings with quotes
and strings without quotes. The only exception is when dealing with some
specific CSS values like `sans-serif` or `inherit` which should not be
quoted. Colour names also have special meaning in Sass and should be
unquoted.

In all other cases, strings should be quoted and I favour single quotes
because they're easier to type and I personally find them neater to look
at.

### Colors

Colors come in many forms such as named colours, hex, `rgb` and `hsl`.

Colours have their own data type because they can be manipulated by
[color functions](http://www.atozsass.com/c) and be added and subtracted
from each other to produce new colours.

{% highlight scss %}
$named-color: black
$hex-color:   #000
$rgba-color:  rgba( 0, 0, 0, 1 )
$hsla-color:  hsl( 0, 0%, 0%, 1 )
{% endhighlight %}

### Boolean

Booleans are either `true` or `false` and aren't particularly useful for
setting values for CSS properties but *are* very useful when combined
with logical flow control whilst building complex components, frameworks
or library code. There's a whole video coming up on loops and flow
control - keep your eye out for that to see a good use case for boolean
variables

### Null

`null` is a special data type which represents and empty value. If
a variable contains a null value, applying this to a CSS property will
cause that line of code to be removed at compile time:

{% highlight scss %}
$font-size: null;
$line-height: 1.2;

.title {
	font-size: $font-size;
	line-height: $line-height;
}

/* compiles to
.title {
	line-height: 1.2;
}
*/
{% endhighlight %}

### Lists

Lists contain multiple values separated by spaces or commas. They are
used to represent shorthand declarations like `margin` and `padding` or
for font stacks. You can have a list that contains other
variables or even a list of lists.

{% highlight scss %}
$space-separated-list: 0 0 20px 0;
$comma-separated-list: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
$variable-list: $space-separated-list, $comma-separated-list;
{% endhighlight %}

### Maps

For more complex lists of variables, one final data type is "map"
variables. These contain a store of key and value pairs like
a JavaScript object or Ruby hash and are a very powerful new feature of
Sass 3.3.

{% highlight scss %}
$font-sizes: (
	h1: 50px,
	h2: 36px,
	h3: 24px,
	h4: 20px,
	p:  18px
);
{% endhighlight %}

Because there's a lot discuss regarding maps, we'll cover them in detail
in their own video in Episode 13.

So, with all these different types of variable values, what can we do
with them?



## Sass Maths

The different types of Sass variables can be used as they are, or we can
apply a number of different mathematical operations to them to make
their use more flexible.

With whole numbers or decimals, we can add, subtract, multiply, divide
and modulo (which returns the remainder after a division). 

When using mathematical operations with length values in Sass (values
like 10px or 2em), we do need to be mindful of the length units as many
units are incompatible.

I've set up a local project with my Sass watching for changes on the 
command line. I've got Sublime Text open with the `style.scss` file on
the left and the compiled `style.css` file on the right.

We'll use this setup to demonstrate some Sass maths and show the
compiled CSS each time a change is made. 

Lengths with matching units can be added and subtracted from each other.
However, lengths with matching units can't be multiplied together.

{% highlight scss %}
$a: 20px;
$b: 10px;

div { width: $a + $b }
div { width: $a - $b }
{% endhighlight %}

Dividing lengths with the same units results in a number with no units.
This can be a handy trick for stripping the units from any length value
so you can perform further Sass operations on the plain number value.

{% highlight scss %}
$a: 100px;
$b: 20px;

$number: $a / $b; // 5
{% endhighlight %}

When dealing with mixed units such as `px` and `em`, Sass will throw an
error when trying to perform operations on them.

{% highlight scss %}
$a: 20em;
$b: 10px;

div {
	padding: $a + $b; // error
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you do need to perform calculations with mixed units, this can
actually be done in normal CSS with the `calc()` function which is
supported in IE9+.

When working with mathematical operations in Sass, it's always a good
practice to leave whitespace around the operator. This makes the code
more readable and reduces the risk of confusing mathematical operators
for other normal CSS characters like hyphens or forward slashes.

Sass variables and maths are a great combination and can really help to
add meaning and clarity to your code. And instead of the result of
a calculation being declared as a value, you can see the maths write
there in the code. I'm not a huge fan of maths in general but Sass
certainly sweetens the deal.

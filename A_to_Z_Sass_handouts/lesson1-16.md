Today we're going to talk about Sass performance. This is a tricky
subject and one that is often very specific to each individual project,
its dependencies, the local or production environment and the scale of
the project.

However, performance is an important subject so it's something I wanted
to try and tackle.


## Improving Compiler Performance

Having a solid workflow when writing code is really important to make
sure you can work as quickly as you need to.

Sass needs to be compiled into CSS before it can be read by the browser
and this compile step can sometimes become a bit of a bottle neck and
start slowing down your development.

On a recent client project (which I inherited from an agency in pretty
terrible shape) compile time for the styles was frequently taking over
14 seconds. On a similar scale project of my own, styles take
less than 1 second to compile. So why such a difference?

The Client Project (which shall remain nameless) has the following
setup:

* Ruby Sass 
* Compass mixin library
* 2 compiled stylesheets
* 67 partials
* Grunt task for compiling

My Personal Project (The Food Rush food tech magazine) has the following
setup:

* Node Sass
* Autoprefixer
* 1 compiled stylesheet
* 42 partials
* Gulp task for compiling

While the client project has 25 more partials and 1 more compiled
stylesheet, I believe the major bottleneck in this compile process is
the Compass library and the use of Ruby Sass.

Compass is a library full of all sorts of handy mixins and functions for
working with Sass. The majority of which provides CSS3 mixins for
handling vendor prefixes across different browsers. Compass modules can
be loaded on a case by case basis or you can include the whole library
(as has been done on this project) by importing it in your compiled
stylesheets:

{% highlight scss %}
@import 'compass';
{% endhighlight %}

Having analysed the whole repository for this client project, the only Compass
mixins being used are for:

* transitions
* transform
* opacity
* box-sizing

These are widely supported without any vendor prefixes. If prefixes were
needed to support a particular range of browsers, it wouldn't be hard to
add these manually, create a custom mixin as needed or use an automated
tool for prefixing like Autoprefixer.

The second change to improve the performance of compiling this project
would be to switch from using Ruby Sass to Libsass (often done through
the node-sass wrapper as part of a Gulp task).

Libsass is a C/C++ port of the original Ruby Sass engine and runs
incredibly fast. If you refer back to the episode about Grunt and Gulp,
you'll see the difference in compile time for exactly the same code:
Ruby Sass with Grunt compiled in __1.519 seconds__ and Node Sass with Gulp
compiled in __10 mili-seconds__. Check out this video for practical step
by step instructions to use Grunt or Gulp to compile your Sass (I'd
recommend Gulp, but that's just my personal preference these days).

For more details and some cold hard numbers about compile times of
various versions of Sass and other preprocessors, take a look at this
post on [Opinionated Programmer](https://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/css-preprocessor-benchmark/).

It's worth mentioning that Libsass doesn't support every single Sass
feature that's in Ruby Sass. But in my experience I haven't found this
to be an issue and have yet to run into a Ruby Sass feature that's not
supported in Libsass that's been a blocker on any project so far.

So to wrap up this part of the discussion, there are really two
takeaways:

To improve the performance of your compiler, __reduce the amount of
plugins and/or libraries__ used in a project and __try Libsass__ for
super-fast compile times.


## Optimising CSS for Performance

Moving away from thinking about performance in terms of speed and
efficientcy in our workflow, let's turn our attention to writing Sass
that compiles to compact, clean and clear CSS.

I've spent many hours writing CSS and have tried a number of modular
coding techniques, naming conventions, methodologies like OOCSS and
SMACSS and experimented with both `@extend` and `@mixin` a lot.

It would probably take hours to go into fine detail about what I've
learned on the topic so I've tried to distill it down into 5 tips
for writing Sass that outputs CSS without too much bloat.

### Tip 1: Read your compiled CSS

When optimising anything, it's important to know what you're optimising.
Being aware of the CSS that's being generated from your Sass is
sometimes all you need to know whether your generated code is compact
and lightweight or bloated and a bit of a mess.

If you're working on a large project, reading through the whole compiled
stylesheet might be impossible so why not just experiment with some
snippets of code on Sassmeister or Codepen to check the compiled output.


### Tip 2: Avoid over qualified selectors and nesting

Specificity is something to keep in mind when writing Sass or CSS. The
more specific selectors you write, the more specific selectors you'll
need to override previously declared styles. This can lead to many more
lines of code and can make life difficult for yourself and/or other
members of your team.

Avoid over-qualified selectors like `a.button` or `div.main` as this
limits the reuse of these styles. If you think you need to modify
existing styles for specific elements, adding a modifier class is
a better approach than differentiating by element type which can be very
limiting.

It's almost impossible to read a blog post or watch a video about Sass
without hearing the warnings about "don't nest too deeply" but it's
worth reiterating: don't nest too deeply.

Nesting selectors can lead you into a false sense of security as you're
only typing something very short but they can compile into something
very long and complex.

I once inherited a project which had a `_homepage.scss` file containing
over 1000 lines of Sass. The first line of code was `body.homepage {` and
every other line of code was nested inside that. This means that these
1000 lines of code would only ever apply to a page who's `body` element
had a class of `homepage`. This is the opposite of modular and reusabel
code and was a nightmare to maintain.


### Tip 3: Be wary of mixins (but don't worry about them too much)

We've looked at mixins in previous videos and I cover them in detail
in my Up and Running with Sass ebook.

Mixins are used to generate similar patterns of code throughout
a codebase. They often get a bad reputation because they generate
multiple lines of (almost) identical code.

My advice is to be aware of the mixins you use to ensure they don't
generate unnecessary duplication.

However, don't worry about this too much as this kind of duplication can
be heavily compressed with gzip and the apparent "bloated CSS" can
actually end up very compact.

### Tip 4: Avoid extend

Yet another favourite buzz-phrase among Sass users is "don't use
extend". We covered `@extend` in [Episode 5](http://www.atozsass.com/e)
and talked about it's pros and cons at length.

Without revisting the exact same argument, to imrpove the performance of
your compile times and your generated CSS I would avoid using `@extend`
for anything other than utility classes.


### Tip 5: Consider using multiple compiled stylesheets

Finally, a tip that may seem a little contradictory of the ususal advice
about the importance of concattenating multiple files into one to reduce
http requests.

In some cases it may be better for performance to have multiple compiled
stylesheets that are loaded on different pages of a large site or
application.

Let me explain.

Imagine you have a site with a load of content and informational pages
and an online shop. The shop has a number of pages and templates that
show off products, product detail pages and all the various steps for
adding things to a basket, checkout process, thank you pages and all
that jazz. 

These pages would no doubt have a significant amount of
custom components and styles that aren't used throughout the site. 

These pages are probably only seen by a small percentage of the site's
visitors.

Conventional wisdom says combine scripts and stylesheets into as few
files as possible to reduce http requests. However, if your single
stylesheet is full of code that only gets used by a small percentage of
your users, would it not make more sense to seperate it out into two
smaller stylesheets?

This also has caching benefits too. With one massive stylesheet,
a change in the CSS to any distinct part of the website will break the
cache on the single file meaning all users need to re-download it. If
a small change is made to the ecommerce styles then the main stylesheet
will remain cached and only customers to the shop will need to
re-download the updated stylesheet.


## Bonus Performance Tips

Don't forget that making CSS perform better (either for developer
happiness or for users) is kind of a micro optimisation. 

Get the low hanging fruit out of the way first: turn on gzip, compress
images, leverage caching, compress and minify assets and consider using
CDNs.

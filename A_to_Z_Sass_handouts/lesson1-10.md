Having embraced the power of Sass and started to use variables to
configure various settings in your project - such as colours, font sizes
and media query breakpoint - you might start to wonder how you can share
these values between other front-end languages such as JavaScript.

In programming we want to minimise duplication and declaring variables
in both your Sass files and your JavaScript files would be a maintenance
nightmare.

There are a couple of ways to share data between Sass and JS using JSON.
In this episode we'll cover the theory rather than the practice to keep
things brief and to not end up going too deep down a JS rabit hole.

## Sass Maps and JSON

In this series so far, we've not spent too much time looking at Sass
maps as we'll have a whole video coming up very soon.

However, Sass maps and JSON serve a very similar purpose and have quite
a similar syntax.

They are both stores of key and value pairs that can hold all sorts of
different types of values, each with a unique key or label.

Here is a comparrison of the two, with Sass on the left and JSON on the
right:

{% highlight scss %}
$colors: (
	pink: '#cc3f85',
	blue: '#94d6ed',
	purple: '#a485fb',
	yellow: '#e3db6f'
);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight JSON %}
{
	"colors": {
		"pink": "#cc3f85",
		"blue": "#94d6ed",
		"purple": "#a485fb",
		"yellow": "#e3db6f"
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

As the syntax of both these data types is quite similar, it's possible
to convert a Sass map into JSON or JSON into a Sass map. 

Before looking into how this can be done, let's first think about *why*
we might want to do it. Every project is different but there are some
common use cases for sharing data:

* Sharing colours for switching between different visual themes
* Sharing breakpoint values for detecting screensizes in JS
* Sharing breakpoint values for working with responsive images
* Sharing version information or other meta data across languages

Let's start by looking at how Sass can be converted to JSON and made
availabe to our JS files.



## Sass -> JSON

Styling information should be kept in Sass/CSS as much as possible so
starting with a Sass variable and converting it into JSON seems like
a logical first approach.

The idea is to convert the Sass map into a JSON string and then apply it
to the `content` property of a [psuedo
element](http://www.atozcss.com/p) so it can then be read by JS. A good
choice is the `body:before` element as this is rarely used for any
visual purpose.

After processing our Sass into JSON (more on that later) our compiled
CSS might look like this:

{% highlight css %}
body:before {
	display:none!important;
	content: '{ "colors": { "pink": "#cc3f85", "blue": "#94d6ed", "purple": "#a485fb", "yellow": "#e3db6f" } }';
}
{% endhighlight %}

This value can then be read by JavaScript using the `getComputedStyle`
method, santized and parsed into JSON.

{% highlight javascript %}
var santizeContent = function( string ) {
	return string.replace(/^['"]+|\s+|\\|(;\s?})+|['"]$/g, '');
}
var getSassVars = function() {
	var style = null;

	if ( window.getComputedStyle && window.getComputedStyle(document.body, '::before') ) {
		style = window.getComputedStyle(document.body, '::before');
		style = style.content;
	}
	return JSON.parse( santizeContent( style ) );
}
var sassVars = getSassVars();
{% endhighlight %}

Having gone through this somewhat long-winded process, your Sass
variables are now available in JavaScript and can be accessed through
the `sassVars` JS variable: 

{% highlight javascript %}
var blue = sassVars.colours.blue;
console.log( blue ); // #94d6ed;
{% endhighlight %}



## JSON -> Sass

An alternative and slightly simpler approach is to start with a JSON
file that contains all the shared variable information.

Using a third-party tool like [Sass JSON
vars](https://viget.com/extend/sharing-data-between-sass-and-javascript-with-json),
the JSON can be imported into your Sass files direct.

{% highlight bash %}
gem install sass-json-vars
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scss %}
@import 'shared-variables.json';
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
sass scss/main.scss:css/main.css -r sass-json-vars --watch
{% endhighlight %}

This technique leverages the computing power of a more powerful language
to do the conversion rather than leaning on Sass to parse its native map
variables into a JSON string.

And because JSON is easily consumed by JS, there's little work to be
done on the JavaScript side other than to load the file - no extra
parsing or sanitization required! 

If I ever need to share data between the two languages, this is the
approach I'd use for sure.

So, let's take a look at some other conversion tool that can help make
this happen.



## Tools

When researching this topic, I came across a number of blog posts and
tools to help convert Sass to JSON. This is a relatively advanced topic
but it seems the desire to share data between languages is strong.

To aid in converting Sass maps to JSON, check out

[SassyJSON](http://hugogiraudel.com/2014/01/20/json-in-sass/) is
a pure Sass solution that converts Sass maps to JSON by Hugo Giraudel.

[Sass to JS](https://blog.gospodarets.com/passing_data_from_sass_to_js/) is
another Sass tool that converts Sass to JSON but also bundles JS helpers
to aid in reading them from CSS into JS

To go the other way round and start with JSON and convert it to Sass
there's [Sass JSON
vars](https://viget.com/extend/sharing-data-between-sass-and-javascript-with-json)
which we've already discussed. This is a ruby gem that allows you to
directly import a JSON file with the Sass `@import` command. There is an
alternative version if you're using Node Sass with something like [Gulp
for compiling your styles](http://www.atozsass.com/g).

I also found another Gulp plugin called
[gulp-json-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-json-sass) which
converts a JSON file into a Sass file with a series of global variables.

So whether or not you have the need to share variables between your Sass
and your JavaScript, I hope this trip down the Sass rabit hole has
demonstrated just how much power we have at our fingertips when using
this fantastic tool.

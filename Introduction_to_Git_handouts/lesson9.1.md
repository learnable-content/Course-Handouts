# Introduction

So far we've completed our project and in this lesson, you will learn about GitHub pages and move over our project to a GitHub page.

# What is a GitHub page?

Now, a **GitHub page** is a web page hosted by GitHub where you can upload your project for others to view. This can be a great way to showcase your work to potential employers and customers.

There are two types of Github pages:

* A user Github page on which you can showcase your portfolio
* Project page. This is the one we'll be using to upload our project for other people to view.

GitHub pages are completely free, but you get the `github.io` domain. The full URL for a GitHub project page includes `user_name.github.io/repo_name`.

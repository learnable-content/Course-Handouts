# Introduction

Git was developed by Linus Torvald, who also authored the Linux kernel.

Git is a tool, whereas GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service that uses Git. You work with Git by typing commands in the terminal. We'll learn lots of commands throughout this course.

# Benefits of learning Git

* You can keep all versions of your code, in case you need to come back to a previous version. This saves a lot of time and effort.
* You can showcase code samples on GitHub to potential employers. Think of GitHub as a LinkedIn for code.
* You can also showcase your work to potential customers by putting up your work on a GitHub page.
* You can collaborate with other developers, keep yourself updated with trending repositories.
* You can fork repositories and play around with the code, ultimately learning more. The fork feature on GitHub allows you to make a copy of someone else's code, and we'll come to this in lesson ten.

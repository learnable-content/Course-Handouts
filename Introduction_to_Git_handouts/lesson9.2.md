# Introduction

To move our project over to a GitHub page, we'll be making a separate GitHub branch, and then we'll push our branch from the terminal.

# Putting Your Project on a GitHub Page.

Let's check out and make a new branch called GitHub Pages:

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
```

`gh` stands for GitHub. This branch will contain all the merged changes from earlier on and is ready to be showcased on a GitHub page.

The last step is to push a branch with

```
git push origin gh-pages
```

It can take up to ten minutes for your project to be published on a GitHub page, so be patient.

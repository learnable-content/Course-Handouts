# Introduction

In this section, we'll talk about forking.

# What is Git forking?

`git fork` allows you to make a copy of someone else's repo in your own GitHub account. So, let's go ahead and give that a try. Click on Explore at the top of the GitHub website. Open any repo.

To fork a repo, all you have to do is click on the Fork button on the right-hand side which will make a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account.So click that button.

Now, if you wanted a copy of this repo on your computer locally, you would simply clone the forked repo. Forking allows you take someone else's project as a starting point for your own. It also lets you look at the code base of a project and make your own modifications, eventually, contributing to the original project, or you can simply fork a project and play around with the code.

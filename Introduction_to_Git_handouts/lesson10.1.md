# Introduction

In this lesson we'll be talking about three new concepts: cloning, forking and pulling.

# What is Git cloning?

`git clone` will copy all the contents of your repo into a new directory. Think of a it as of copying and pasting of all your files into a new folder. Cloning is a great way to make multiple copies of your work.

Open your GitHub repo. On the bottom right hand side of the page, you can see the HTTPS clone URL. Copy it to your clipboard and head over to the terminal where we'll clone our repo.

Navigate to the desktop

```
cd Desktop
```

Now, we'll use the `git clone` command to clone the remote repo on our desktop:

```
git clone URL
```

Paste the clone URL instead of `URL`.

Now you can navigate to your Desktop and check that all the files were copied successfully. So cloning is a great way of saving multiple copies of your own work.

# Introduction

Before we start doing our project, let's go ahead and first set things up.

# Setting Up Project

Navigate to [startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com) where we're going to be downloading a free Twitter Bootstrap theme. Click on Browse Themes and Templates, and then scroll down. On the left side, where it says Business Casual, click on Preview and Download. Go on and download it. Then unzip files on your desktop and rename the folder to *theme*.

Open the *theme* folder using a code editor. I'm using Sublime Text, and you can download it for free from [sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com).

Next open up your repo on GitHub.

Lastly open your terminal and type

```
git config --globalcolor.ui "auto"
```

This will set the color settings for Git.

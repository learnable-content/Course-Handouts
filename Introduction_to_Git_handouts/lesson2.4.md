# Configuring Git

To configure Git on your computer, open up your terminal. It doesn't matter if you're a Mac, Windows or Linux user: everyone has to use a terminal.

Type in two commands:

```
git config --global user.name "your_github_user_name"
git config --global user.email "your_github_email"
```

Put your GitHub user name and e-mail address in quotes.

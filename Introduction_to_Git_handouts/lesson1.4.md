# Git v/s GitHub

Before we move on to the next lesson, let's briefly discuss the differences between Git and GitHub.

* Now, Git is a **version control tool** which runs on the terminal. It keeps a track of modifications made to files in a local Git repository on your computer.
* GitHub is a **code-sharing and publishing website** that hosts Git repositories, so it has a collection of repositories. This means that you and other developers will send over local repositories from your computer to your GitHub account, where they'll be hosted online. GitHub doesn't run on the terminal: instead, it has features such as clone, pull requests, and fork.

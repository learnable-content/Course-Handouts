# What is Namespace?

In this step we're going to talk about **namespace**. Namespace is used to group and encapsulate variables and mixins. It's like a bundle of less rules which is grouped together under a single namespace.

Why should you use namespace? You can group variables and mixins under Namespace by using an ID selector to keep them separate from other rule sets that you may have in your Less code. This can be very handy when you have a lot of Less rules, that includes multiple Less variables and mixins, and you want to keep them from conflicting with other rule sets.

# Creating namespace

To define a Namespace, we're going to use an ID selector:

```less
#navigation {
	.links() {
		color: @color;
	}
}
```

Inside we include a mixin.

# Namespace Demonstration

Now let's put that into practice. Define the `Link` namespace:

```lesss
#Link { }
```

Inside we're going to have a bundle of code:

```less
#Link {   
 .underline() {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: lighten(@template_color, 50%);
      
      &:hover { 
       text-decoration: underline;
       color: darken(@template_color, 15%);

      }
  }

  .border() {

    text-decoration: none;
    color: lighten(@template_color, 50%);
    padding: @padding/4;

      &:hover { 
       	.bordered;
       	padding: @padding/4;
        color: darken(@template_color, 15%);
      }
  }
}
```

Note that inside the `border` mixin I am using another mixin called `bordered` that we've defined earlier. Also note that I am using the `/` (division) operator.

Now we are now going to use these mixins in our Less code:

```less
nav {
  background: lighten(@template_color,10%);
  ul {
  	margin: 0;
  	li {
			display: inline-block;
			font-size: @fontSize;
			margin: @margin @margin+20;
			a {
				#Link > .border();
			}
		}
  }
}
```

First of all I am refering to the `#Link` namespace and use the `>` symbol followed by the name of the mixin that I want to include.

Go ahead and check that into the browser. You will note that a basic CSS code was generated by the compiler.

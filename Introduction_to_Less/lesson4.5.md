# Introduction

In this step we will continue speaking about namespacing, which is going to allow us to access a group of code by using the namespace `commonRules`. We will style the "Team" section now.

# Styling Team section

the LESS code on the right, this corresponds to the ID selector team.So we're going to open the file mixins.less inside of which we havethe declared the mixins commonRules.So this one includes a bundle of code, so mixins, classes, variables,which is going to allow us to target elements of the section team,in order to format the layout of this one.So remember that we have a div with a class top and a div with a class grid.And with the class grid, we're targeting so the div to create a four column layout.We are targeting also headings.And finally we are targeting image elements as well.So we have some images in that section.And we're going to be about to apply those correspondingCSS properties in order to format so the images.So we're going to use the mixin library LESS elements.Inside we're going to find a mixin named rounded.And this one is a parametized mixin that takes one default.So parametized mixin with default.And the default value is two pixels.Then we're going to override this one by using the value 50% in order to createa circle shape for the images.And this mixin includes already the CSS vendor prefixes for webkit and moz, andthat's going to allow the design to be rendered properly for the webkit browser,that includes Chrome and Safari, and also Firefox with moz.So we're not going to need to write those ones yourself.So that's going to be automatically generated in the output in CSS.So now we've had overview of the team section.So we know which element will be targeted by which CSS properties, andalso by which mixin.So we're going to use this one so the namespace commonRules.We're going to add this one as well as to the ID selector team.So once you're done,then we're going to be able to now have the styling for the team section.And here it is so now we have the h2 andthe p element which is formatted, designed, and saved for the images.So we're using the mixin rounded which is allowing us to have a circleshape for the images.Next, what we're going to do,we're going to replace the placeholders with actual images andyou're going to find this one inside the folder images and the folder team.We're going to replace the placeholder with actual path to the images, sothat's going to be images/team then ashley.png, P-N-G for the first one.And we're going to do the same for the other ones.And then once this is done, you can then save, then go back to the browser.And here you go.So now we have our team section.And also when you hover over, you have this nice hover effect.So remember that we have also applied the hover effect inside the namespace,commonRules to apply for the image element.

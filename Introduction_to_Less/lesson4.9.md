# Customising Footer

In this step we will customize the footer.

So we're going to go to the code editor, and find the correspondingfolder and files in order to customize this section of the page.And this code responds to the footer elements,where we can read Copyright 2015.And we also have the less code on the right, andto target the footer elements, so we're using the footer selector.So that's going to be this last part, and in order to customize actually the footer,we're going to be using the exact same mixin that we used initially forthe navigation.So that is going to be the mixin bar, in order to apply a similar layout,a similar styling, and if we check again.So this collection of code that we have included in that mixinthat we have declared, will be applied to both the navigation and the footer.So, we're going to save then refresh the page in the browser.And here you go, so now you have this text color, andalso this background color so same as for the navigation.So we're going to check the output in CSS.And you're going to be able to see that we have the exact same CSS properties thatwe have included in the mixin bar.So first for the navigation, so it'd be ID top bar, and also for the footer.And there is one additional CSS property that I'd like to add which is to alignin the center, so the element that we have inside the footer, which is the p element.So we're going to use text align center, and we can read the exact same one, soin the output in CSS, and same in the browser, so after refreshingwe're going to now read Copyright 2015 placed in the middle of the page.

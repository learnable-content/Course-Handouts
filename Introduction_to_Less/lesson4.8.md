# Introduction

In this step I'm going to show you two external resources: Font Awesome and Google Fonts.

# Introduction to Font Awesome

We're going to start first with Font Awesome that has been designed bythe same team that created Bootstrap.That includes a collection of 519 scalable and vector-based icons.Meaning that, they can be customized with size, color, andweight just like any other fonts.So, there is a huge collection.And, we're going to be using the social media icons.So, we have already included those ones in our design in our code.So, in the contact section.So, we are using the class that are provided by Font Awesome.Here it is. So we're going to see how this worksby selecting, so for example, so, the social media icons for Facebook.In order to use the icons, you need two classes.So the first one is the base class that you're going to be using commonly forall the icons, then you're going to use a second class.That's going to apply specifically to the icon that you want to add to your design.So in that instance, that's going to be fa-facebook-official.So we're going to insert this one in an iText.You also have different class options for the size.So, in order to have larger icons, you could use fa-lg,in order to increase the size by 33%.You can also increase two times, twice, twice as much, or three times, four times,and so forth.So we're using all of these subclasses for our templates.So we're using the icons for Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and also Pinterest.And we have decided to increase the size by two.The most important step is to know how to access the resourcesprovided by Font Awesome.So we're going to go to the section of Getting Started, wherewe're going to find the different options in order to get the necessary resources.We have the option to use a CDN.That stands for content delivery network, meaning that the required resourcesare hosted by an external hosting services provider, which is a third party.So, the required resources are hosted by MaxCDN in that instance.So we just need to use that URL.And we're going to use the directive @import.And then we're going to insert the CDN.We're going to specify a protocol that's going to be HTTPS.And we must always finish with a semicolon.And that's all there is to it.We're going to refresh the page, and we're going to be able to see that now wehave so these font icons for the social media.And we have this nice hover effect as well.So we're going to see how we can obtain this nice hover effect.So we are using the namespace inline list, which is targeting the anchor tag.And this anchor tag is actually accessing CSS property that have beenincluded in that namespace, and the corresponding mixins.So inside the namespace that we have defined at the top,we include a couple of mix-ins.And the corresponding one is links_social.And inside this mixin we are also accessingall the CSS property that have been defined in this first mixin.So this is very object oriented, so by including mixins inside other mixinswe can enter it from group code, which are already existing.And then we can override with specific CSS properties.So, for the mixin links_socials,we can enter it from the CSS property that have been defined in the mixin links.Then we can define a specific color which is light, and same forthe hover effect, for which we have decided to have a darker color,whenever we hover over and to remove the border.That's it for Font Awesome.So, next I'd like to introduce you to Google fonts.

# Introduction to Google Font

I'm going to show you how you can integrate it in your design.So for that we're going to go to the page for Google fonts.Here you can search for the font family quicksand,and once you have it you can select quick use which is the icon in the middle.We're going to find then the instruction as to how to integrate this font family toour design.First step, we're going to choose the style, sothat's going to be light, normal, and bold.So bear in mind that this is going to increase the page load time.You can check out on the right.So just have a look on the right as I inject all the boxes.You're going to see that this is going to decrease the page load time.For this demonstration, we're going to select all the styles.But, just remember that this is going to impact, as well, on the page load time.So, next, we're going to see how to add this code to our design, our template.And, for that, you have the standard option first that you can addin the head section of the HTML document.Then you have the option at import.So we're going to select this one and add it to our less code.So we're going to go all the way to the top you can go below libraries.So right below the Font Awesome URL.We're going to add so this Font Awesome resources, this line of code.Then we're going to see how to integrate the font family.And we're going to apply this one to the entire design so that's going to be forthe body selector.And that's it.So now we're going to see the difference with the new font family.And here it is. So now we're using Quicksand forthe font family.That looks pretty nice.So you have just learned that you can use the import directive not only forseparate files, by including them in one single file, butalso to import external resources.

Boolean Variables

We've discussed strings and we've discussed numbers.There's a third data type that I'd like to introduce you to now called Booleans,named after the philosopher, logician, and mathematician, George Boole.Boolean values can hold one of two values, true or false.When an expression can be evaluated as either true orfalse, the result of that evaluation is a Boolean value.That might seem a little abstract, so let me show you how that works.I'm going to create two variables, var value one, we're going to set that to one,and var value two, we're going to set that to 2.Now, these two variables are not equal to each other, because one is equal to 1,and one is equal to 2.How could I determine that programmatically?Well, in JavaScript you can use comparison operators to see the relationshipbetween two variables, and the result of that expression is a Boolean value.Let me show you.Let's create a new variable, we'll call it same.And what we're going to set same tois the comparison between value one and value two.And to compare them we're going to type value 1,two equal signs, and then value 2.And now let'sconsole.log (same).Over here when we run this,what we're going to see is that the value of same is false.False is one of the two values that a Boolean variable can take.Either it's true or it's false, no other options.That double equals sign is one of the comparison operators that you can use inJavaScript to compare two values and turn out a Boolean value.It's important to know the differences among the various comparison
Coercion and Boolean Comparison

operators though, because just saying that two things are the samedoesn't necessarily mean that they're actually the same in JavaScript.That can be a little tricky, so let me show you what I mean.For example, comparing with the two equal signs,forces the two data types of two variables to match.So if one is a string, and one is a number,they are going to be converted to the same data type before the comparison happens.If you want to preserve the data types between two variables before doingthe comparison, use three equal signs.And what you're going to find is frequently when you're programming, you'regoing to want to use the three equal signs comparison instead of the two equal signcomparison, in order to be sure that what you're comparing actually is the same.Let me show show you the code for that, so you can get a feel for it.I'm going to create two more variables.I'm going to make value1 and I'm going to set it to the number 1.I'm also going to make value2 and I'm going to set it to the string 1.Now again, strings and numbers are not same.You can't use the string methods on number values, andyou can't use the number methods on string values.You remember what happens when you start mixing those up.But, let's make a "same" variable, and set that tovalue1 with two equals signs is the same as value2.And then we're going to console.log same, again.If we go over here and Run, we're going to to see the JavaScript thinksthat this number one and this string one are actually the same.And that's because when you use the two equal signs both value one and value twoare coerced, or converted, into string variables before the comparison happens.To contrast that, let's make a new variable called exact, andwe're going to set that to value1 with three equal signsis compared to value2.And again we're going to console.log exact.Let's Clear and Run again.What we see now, is that while same coerces both variablesinto being strings, exact using three equal signs,preserves the data type of each variable before making the comparison.So it recognizes that the number one and the string one are not the same.
Boolean Comparison Operators

But you can do more with JavaScript in terms of comparing variables then justseeing whether they're equal to the same value.I'm going to introduce you to several of the comparisonoperators that you may find convenient while you're working with variables.First, we've already seen the two equals signs, which is match with coercion, andthe three equals signs,which is exact match, preserving the data types of the variables.You can also use a greater than to see whether the first variable is actuallylarger than the second variable.You can use greater than or equal to, which sees whether ornot the first variable is larger than or the same as the second variable.You can use less than, which shows whetherthe first variable was less than ora match for the second variable.And then you can also use the exclamation mark equal sign, which shows whether ornot the two variables do not equal each other.And these operators will get you through a lot of situations where you need todo comparisons in JavaScript.Let me show how they work.
Examples of Boolean Comparison Operators

We're going to start by creating two new variables, number1,which is equal to 1, and number2, which is equal to 2.And then we're going to create some comparison variables.First we'll go with same and we're going toset that to number1 is equal to number2.With coercion.We're going to make another variable called exact.We're going to set that to number1 isequal to number2 without coercion.Going to make a variable called greater, setthat equal to number1 is greater than number2.We'll make a variable called less, andwe're going to set that to number1 Is less than number2.And we're going to make a variable called notEqual.We're going to set that to number1 is not equal to number2.Now let's console.log a few of these.Let's console.log same,console.log exact,console.log greater,Console.log(less), andconsole.log(notEqual).Now, if I clear Clear and Run, we're going to see thataccording to JavaScript, the number1 is not the same as number2.The number1 is not the exact same as number two.The number one is also not greater than number2, butthe number1 is less than the number2, and the number1 is not equal to the number2.You can use these operators when you're testing valuesin order to determine what you want your program to do next.It's important to know which values come back as trueaccording to JavaScript when you test them.JavaScript is going to treat any real value that is not empty or
True Values

equal to zero as if it were true.So the Boolean value of a string that has content in it, or any number other thanzero, is going to return true, and it's important to know this.JavaScript includes a method called Booleanthat let's you test the Boolean value of any variable.So let's do a console.log andpull up the Boolean of the number1.If we Run that, we'll see that JavaScript thinks that the number1 is a true value.Similarly, if we console.log the Booleanof a string like word, and Run that,we'll see that a string with contents is alsoconsidered true according to JavaScript.A number doesn't have to be positive in order for JavaScript to consider it true.So let's console.log the Boolean of negative 1000.If we run that, we'll see that that's also true.In fact, JavaScript will calculate expressions, andgive you the Boolean values of those as well.So let's try console.log Boolean of two plus two.And if we run that, we'll see that that also gives us a true value.Knowing what JavaScript considers true can prevent you from making mistakes whenyou're evaluating situations, and trying to determine what you want to do next.
False Values

But it's also important to know what values JavaScript considers false.JavaScript will return false for zero, for empty strings, forundefined variables, and expressions that return Not a Number values.Let me show you how those work.What if we declare a variable, but we don't set it to any value.Let's call it variable valueless.And it's been declared but we haven't actually given it a value.How about if we console.log the Boolean of valueless?We'll see that a variable that has been declared, butthat hasn't been set to a value is considered false.Similarly, let's create a variable that's set to Not a Number.Var not Number, and we're going to get that by setting2 times word, which we know will give us not a number.And now let's console.log Boolean of Not Number.If we Clear and Run that, we'll see that Not a Numbervalues are also considered false by JavaScript.Similarly, let's console.log the Boolean ofan empty string, with nothing inside of it, andlet's console.log the Boolean of the number zero.If we Clear andRun this, we'll see that all of these values are considered false by JavaScript.Not all programming languages would consider zero, oran empty string, as false values.So, if you're coming from a different programming language to JavaScript,it's important to know that that's the situation here.

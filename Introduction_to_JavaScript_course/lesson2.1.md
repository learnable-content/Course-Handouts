Introduction

Hello, and welcome to lesson two of Introduction to Programming usingJavaScript.Today I'm going to be talking to you a little bit about syntax, variables andtypes.And these are terms you may not be familiar with, orif you've heard them, you may not know exactly how to use them.Now, this course in JavaScript is going to be taking you through the fundamentals ofJavaScript.I'm not going to be covering every detail comprehensively.You'll be given a foundation in this class for how to program in JavaScript,the core language independent of the environment in which you work.Learning what syntax, variables, and types are is an important place to start sowe have a shared vocabulary.
Syntax

First, I'd like to talk with you about syntax.Every language has a syntax, including the language I'm speaking to you right now.Syntax is about how the elements of a language are arranged sothat they can be processed and understood consistently.That's true whether I'm speaking to you in English, orwhether I'm writing a program for a computer to interpret.For example, an English sentence always starts with a capital letter andends with a punctuation mark.A JavaScript statement always ends with a semicolon.Next, I'd like to talk to you about variables.
Variables

Variables are named pieces of data that can take on different values whilea program is running.By storing values in variables referring to them, and even changing them,you can read and alter the state of your program while it's running.Let me give you a quick example.To create a variable in JavaScript, you start with the var keyword andthen type the name of your variable.An equal sign, and then the value that you want to set your variable to.And the error message is telling me I need my semicolon at the end, soI'm adding my semicolon.Now when I run this, nothing happens.All that I've done is set the value of the example variable.In order to see that value, I need to do a console.log of example.And again, add my semicolon at the end.When I click Run now,you'll see that the value that I set is being logged in the console.One of the important concepts that we're going to learn as we go through thisclass, is how variables can take on different types.This particular variable is of type string and it contains the word coffee.But there are other data types.And any variable in JavaScript can actually be setto any value of any type that you want.Data types are the different kinds of information that can be stored in
Types

a variable, such as numbers, letters, or even groups of other variables.In JavaScript, any variable can hold data of any type.That's why JavaScript is known as a dynamically typed language.Let me give you a couple of examples of variables with different data types.Let's create a second variable.We'll call it first and give it the value of one.Now, I'm going to show you how to figure out the type of a given variable.Let's do a console.log.We're going to perform a typeof operation on the variable name andI like to put the variable names in parenthesis when I do this.But it's optional.So let's do typeof(example), and put our semicolon at the end.Now let's clear the console and run this.The output that we get is the console.log of (example) here, which is coffee,and then the console.log for the (typeof(example)), which is string.Now let's add a console.log for(typeof(first)).And again, we'll clear the console.And we'll run our code.And what we see is the console.log of (example) gives us coffee,the console.log of the (typeof(example)) gives us string, andthe console.log(typeof(first)) gives us number.JavaScript can show you what the type of any variable is just by asking it.And this can be convenient, because since any variable can contain any typeof value, you might need to know this before running an operation on a variable.

Introduction

Hi, in the last lesson we discussed using JavaScript inside the browser.Now I'm going to show you a way that you can use JavaScript directly in yourterminal, using the Command-line JavaScript with Node.JavaScript can be run on the Command-line, just like any other programming language.And this can be one of the most effective ways to learn how use a programminglanguage, because you get instant andimmediate feedback every time that you enter something.You can also save programs and run them directly from the command line.My preferred way forrunning JavaScript from the command line is to install Node JS.Node JS lets you write JavaScript directly in the terminal.So I'm going to take you through a few quick steps to get Node up and running inyour system, so that if you choose you can do the exercises in this class using Node.First we're going to have you install Node on your system andthis will work whether you are using a Windows, Mac, or Linux.We're going to introduce you quickly to the interactive Node Shell.And then show you how to save and run JavaScript using Node.So to start with, you should go to nodejs.org.
Installing Node

Clicking on the install button will download the version of Node that isappropriate for your operating system.Once you have that downloaded, you can double click on itto go through the installation process for your computer.Now once you have Node installed you'll want to check your installation andsee if it's installed correctly.In order to do that I'm going to bring up my terminal andrun the node dash feed command.The first thing I'm going to do is issue a node dashv command to see if node is installed and running.The dash v command tells node to tell me what version is installed.So I can see that I've installed version 0.12.0,which is the current version at the time that I'm creating this tutorial.When you install it, the current version may be newer.Now that I've verified that Node is installed andrunning properly, I'm going to go into a node shell, just by typing Node.
Checking Your Installation

This gives me a prompt that tells me that the next command that I entercan be JavaScript or anything that can be validly interpreted by JavaScript.For example, I can type 2 + 2.And if I hit return, node will do the calculation for me andshow me that according to JavaScript two plus two is four.I can also run JavaScript commands directly on the command line.For example, console.log, hello.What this does is it runs the console.log command in JavaScriptusing the value, "hello".And gives me the output hello.This tells me that node is correctly installed and running.You might have noticed that node also gave us the word undefinedafter the result of our console.log command.Undefined tells us that that's the return value of the function that we justexecuted.That's something that we're going to be learning about in a lesson very soon.In the mean-time, let me tell you how you can createprograms that are saved as text files on your computer.And then use Node to execute them.That'll run the program from beginning to end exactly the way that you wrote it.So to start with, why don't we create our first JavaScript program to run in Node.
Writing Your First JavaScript Program

I'm going to exit out of my node shell sothat I can be in a position to execute programs once I'm done.To do that, I hold down the control key and type the letter c andthen I do it again.And node will take me out of command shell and get me back to the terminal.Now, let's make this window a little bit smaller.And we'll go over to our text editor.And here in our text editor,we're going to create our first Java Script program file for node.And this first program is going to be very simple.It's just going to be a console.log.This is my first JavaScript program.And let's save this.And for convenience we're just going to save this directly onto our desktop.And we're going to call it first_program.js.Now over here in the terminal we can CD into our desktop,and type node first_program.js.When we hit return, it's going to execute the Java Script in this file.As you can see this is my first JavaScript program.Has been printed out on the console directly from the program that I wrote.Using this technique, you can write JavaScript andexperiment running it in Node.And you can also use this to work through many of the examples in our class.

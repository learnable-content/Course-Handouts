In order to follow along with this course, you're going to need a programmingenvironment in which you can actually write JavaScript code, execute it, andsee the results.I'm going to show you a few different environments.And I'm going to start you off by showing you how to add scripts to HTML documents.Now, there are many places JavaScript runs, as we discussed.One of the most convenient is the Script Element,which can live right inside of an HTML page.But JavaScript can also be run from the command line,using a terminal environment in your own computer.JavaScript can be run on the server, and JavaScript can even be runusing programming environments that exists in the Cloud.If you've written webpages before, or even if you haven't,you're probably familiar with the concept of a basic webpage without any scripts.
Example of a webpage document.

Here's an example of a webpage document.It's a standard HTML document.It's got an HTML element, a head element, a title, anda body where you would put the content of the page.You can save this file as a document with the .html extension in your computer.And then open it up in a browser,you'll see the title represented up here in the current tab of the browser.Now this is a static HTML document, but we could add a button.Give it an id of, say-hi.And give it the label, Hi.And save the document.Now when we reload this in the browser,you'll see that out page has little button that says Hi.If we click on that button, absolutely nothing happens.And the reason that nothing happens is because, even though this button lookslike a dynamic element in your page, it's not actually hooked up to any JavaScript.So it doesn’t do anything.
Adding scripts

Let’s add a little bit of scripts to this.So underneath button we're going to create a script element.And just like any HTML element, we're going to close it.And inside of here we're going to put a little bit of JavaScript.Don't worry if you don't understand this example.This is just to show you how it works.Now that we've pasted a little bit of JavaScript into our page,we can save our document.And then go back to the browser, and hit Reload.And this time, when we click our button,you'll see that the button's been activated with some JavaScript.And you've got an alert coming up.You can write your JavaScript code this way,and this is often the way that you're going to be writing codewhen you're going to be including it in a webpage that you publish on the Internet.But for the sake of this course,I'm going to show you a couple of other ways that you can write your JavaScriptthat might be more convenient for learning how to program.

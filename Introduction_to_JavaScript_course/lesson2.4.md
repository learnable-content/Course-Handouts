Introduction to Statements

Next, we're going to talk about statements.Statements are the building blocks of a JavaScript program.But what is a statement anyway?Well surprise!You've actually already been writing statements.The three lines of code: var greeting, greeting equals "Hello world," andconsole.log greeting are all statements.
Statements Defined

So what is a statement?Statements are sets of instructions that tell the computerhow to perform a specific action, andthere are very few things that you should keep in mind when writing statements.First of all, statements usually begin with a keyword or variable.They always end with a semicolon.And in Java script they are execute sequentially for the most part.I'm going to show you some ways you can get around that later,in order to take advantage of some of the more sophisticated programmingoptions that JavaScript offers.And finally, statements may be grouped together in a block with curly braces.So as I said, statements always perform an action.
Statement Components

In the case of these three statements, the first one,var greeting, declares a variable named greeting.The second statement,greeting equals hello world, assigns a value to the variable greeting.And the third statement, console.log(greeting),performs the log method on the console for greeting.There are a number of components that could go into a JavaScript statement.Some examples are values, and these can be either literal values orthe variables that represent those values.Operators such as the equal sign, expressions,such as 2+2, keywords such as var, andcomments, which are ignored when your JavaScript is executed.JavaScript is very flexible about how you format your statements.White space is completely ignored, butit's important to not let that be an excuse to let your code get messy.Your code has to be readable to programmers as well.So let's show you some examples of how flexible JavaScript can bewhen it comes to statement formatting.Let's start by declaring a variable, var first, and put a semicolon after it.
Statement Formatting

Now without even changing to the next line, I can type varsecond, and JavaScript will recognize those.In fact, I could put a whole lot of space before the word second,that's still completely legitimate JavaScript.You can see that there are no error messages showing up on the bottom.Now let's assign these variables some values.Let's give first a value of one, and let's put that one on another line.As we can see,JavaScript is perfectly fine with the value being assigned on a separate line.Let's try assigning a different value to second.In this case, we can put every component of this statement on a separate line.Now JSbin is going to warn us that putting an equal sign on a separate line is a badidea, but it's still valid JavaScript and it will still work properly.Just to demonstrate that,let's type out a console,give it a .log, andput together first plus second,give it a semicolon, and now let's run.As you can see, we get the value three.All of this different use of white space made no difference tothe actual Java script compiler.This worked perfectly, but the code is very messy.It's important to have a set of conventions forhow you format your JavaScript.
Statement Formatting Conventions

There are some conventions that are worth following,especially when you're just starting out as a programmer working in JavaScript.For example, it's a good idea to have no more than one statement on a single line.You should separate the elements inside of a statement with spaces,so that it's easier to see what you're working with.And when you're working in a block, that is a set of statements that all gotogether inside of curly braces, indent those statements inside of that block, sothat it's clear that they all go together.Let me show you how that would look with the code that we were working on before.In order to clean this up, let's get our variable declarations together in a block.So we've got var first, and var second,separated by just a single space, and then we close our block.We can change this assignment, so that it's all on one line, with a single spacebetween the elements, and we can do the same with this assignment.Finally, we can bring our console.log statement together on a single line.And we can see that this is structured much more cleanly, and when we click run,it functions exactly the same way.JavaScript will let you format your code very flexibly, but it's important to havea set of conventions that you follow, and this is not a bad one to start with.Although, you may develop your own over time.

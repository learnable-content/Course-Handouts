Assignment Operators

Another set of operators that you need to know about are the Assignment Operators,and these change the value of a variable.Now, for our primitive types, assignment is fairly straightforward.
Assignment for Primitive Types

Assignment operators let you set the value of a number, a string,or a Boolean variable.And we've seen a lot of examples of this, so I'll just run through this quickly.Let's set up some simple variables.We're going to make a smallNumber.We're going to set that to 4, and we're going to make a largeNumber.And we're going to set that to 1,000, and, of course,we're already using the assignment operator, which is this equal sign here.One thing that's worth noting is that you can use the assignment numberto change the value of one variable that's already been assigned.So for example, we can take smallNumber and we can set it to 5.Now if we console.log(smallNumber).Of course when we run this, the value we get is four.The assignment operator also lets us change the value of an existing variable.So we can take smallNumber, andwe can assign it the value five, and let's just copy and paste this line again.And if we clear and run, we see that smallNumber is now 5.The assignment operator also lets you assign the value of one primitivevariable to another primitive variable.So for example, we can set smallNumber = largeNumber.And we console.log(smallNumber); now we see that it's equal to 1000.You can also set one variable of one type.Type to a variable of another type.So we can take smallNumber and assign it the value hello.And when we console.log now,smallNumber thinks that it's a string with the word hello in it.And just to be clear, because these are primitive variables, if we console.loglargeNumber now- We'll see that nothing that we've done has changed largeNumber.We were working with a copy of the contents of largeNumberwhen we modified it before.So assignment is very straightforward for primitive types.
Assignment for Reference Types

But assignment is actually pretty straightforward forreference types as well.You assign a variable to an array or an object.Or set values for the subelements of arrays and objects.And we'll just go through that quickly.Let's create a variable called myArray andwe're going to set that to an array containing the number 1 andthe string "hello".Now let's create another variable called newArray, andwe're going to set that to myArray.And if we console.log (myArray), andconsole.log(newArray); andwe Run that.We see that they're both equal to the same array value.Now if we change the value of a sub-element of newArray.So, for example, subelement zero.We change that from 1 using the assignment operator to 2.And then if we copy and paste these console log commands-As we can see because an array is a reference variable,changing newArray also changed myArray.Using the assignment operator to change one element of newArray,also changed the same element in myArray.They referenced the same location in memory.And let's demonstrate that the same thing is true with objects.If we Delete this and Clear this, let's make a variable called myObject.And we're going to set thatto an object with a colorof red and the size of five.And then we're going to create another variable called newObject.We're going to set that to my object.Now, if we console.log-(myObject.color); andconsole.log(newObject.color);And Run, we'll see that I made a typo and left out the j in myObject here.So let's Clear and Run that again.What we see is that myObject.color and newObject.color are both set to red.If we change newObject.color byassigning it a value of blue.And then copy and paste these console.log lines again.The Clear and Run we'll see once again that becauseobjects are reference variables, the change to the color elementof newObject also changed the color element of myObject.So that's classical assignment as we've seen it before.But JavaScript offers a few other options for assignment as well.
Add and Subtract Assignment

There are Add and Subtract Assignment operators in JavaScript.Add and Subtract assignment operators can change a primitive variable's value,by adding or subtracting a value.And we've seen something similar to this before with the increment anddecrement operators, but this lets you add any value, not just one.And remember, just because you can add strings to numbers,doesn't mean you can subtract strings from numbers.If you try you'll get not a number as a result.Let's create a few variables.Then we'll make a firstNumber variable,we're going to set that to four.We're going to make a secondNumber variable,we're going to set that to 1,000 and let's make a word variable.We're going to set that to hello.Now I'm going to use the add assignment operator to add the first two variablestogether.So I'm going to do firstNumber += secondNumber.And what this is going to do, is it's going to add the value of secondNumber tofirstNumber changing firstNumber at the same time.So, let's do a console.log now of firstNumber and when we run this,we'll see that firstNumber has actually been changed to 1004.SecondNumber was added to firstNumber.And firstNumber was changed to the sum of thoseby using this operator that both adds and assigns at the same time.If we want to go back to where we were,we can do firstNumber which is the new value,1004 minus equals SecondNumber,which is still 1,000.-= And now,If we copy and paste, in console.log (firstNumber),we'll see that firstNumber is back to four.The addition assignment operator works with strings as well.So, for example, we can do, word +=firstNumber;.And if we console.log(word); and Clear and Run.You see that word now equals hello4.The four was converted into a string and concatenated usingthe concatenation function of the += operator which applies to strings.And at the same time the value was assigned to word.It's worth nothing, if we take firstNumber andwe try to -= hello word and thenwe console.log(firstNumber); we go over here and we Clear and we Run again.We'll see that now firstNumber has been set to not a number.We've lost the value that was in firstNumber and this illegal mathematicaloperation resulted in the not a number value in JavaScript, soit can be very convenient to be able to modify a variable by quickly adding orsubtracting another value.And similarly, you can also modify variables using multiply, divide and
Multiply, Divide, Modulus Assignment

mod assignments.This changes number variables using multiplication, division andthe modulus, or remainder assignment.Let me show you a few examples of those.We'll start again with three variables.A small firstNumber, a larger secondNumber, and a word.Let's start by setting firstNumberto *= secondNumber; andthen let's console.log the newvalue of (firstNumber).If we go over here and Run, we'll see that firstNumber is now have been set to 3000,as you would expect because we've use to multiplies equals assignment operator.Similarly, we can set firstNumberto /= by secondNumber; andif we console.log(firstNumber); again.And we Clear and we Run.We'll see that the /= assignment operator divides the new value of the firstNumberby the original value of secondNumber.And brings us back to the original value that we had for firstNumber.And the modulus equals operator behaves exactly the way you would expect.Let's do secondNumber %= firstNumber; andnow let's console.log(secondNumber);And if we clear, and we'll run again, we see that the number 3 divides intothe number 1,000 evenly, leaving a remainder of only one when it's done.But just as with the other arithmetic operators, we cannot doa firstNumber *=, or divided equals,or modulus equals word or any string variable.If we try and then we do a console.log of what's left in firstNumber.Then we Clear and we Run again.We'll see that firstNumber has been set to not a number.And that's because of course, multiplication, division, andmodulus cannot be applied to the strings.So for primitive variables and particularly fornumbers, the assignment operators are very convenient.
Not for Reference Variables

But it's not really a good idea to use them forour reference variables that we've seen.There are some surprising results that may come out if you try.And I'm going to give you a quick demonstration of what I mean.Let's setup some variables.First, I'm going to create var called aNumber.I'm going to set that to just three.And let's create a var that's an array.We're just going to call it arr.And we'll make an array of two numbers, 1 and 2.And let's create an object as well, var obj.And we're going to set that to age- 25.So it's an object with just one key value pair inside of it.And let's not forget that equal sign in here.Okay, so just to show you what we have,let's console.log(arr); andconsole.log (typeof(arr)),using the optional parentheses with typeof.And we'll also console.log(obj.age); andconsole.log(typeof(obj)); andthere should be no surprises here.When we Run this, what we'll get is,console.log(arr) is just the array that we created with the numbers 1 and 2 in it.And the typeof array is object,because arrays are actually considered objects in JavaScript.Console.log(obj.age); gives us 25 andtypeof obj is again object.So nothing unusual there, but let's go to arr andlet's use the += to add aNumber to arr.And now copy and paste those because it's more convenient.We'll console.log(arr), and we'll console.log(typeof(arr)).If we clear and run again, we got some surprising results.In this case console.log(arr) after we +=that a number value, gives us 1,23 in quotes.As a string, that we can see from the type of arr that it's beenconverted to a string because we used this += augmentor.Now similarly,if we go to obj and+= aNumber; andlet's repeat those console.logs forobj.age and typeof(obj).Let's see what we get here.Now, if we Run this, we'll see that obj.age is no longer even defined.It doesn't exist because obj has been converted to a string, andwe can even console.log obj itself as a string.And, if we clear, and run,we'll see that counter intuitively obj has been converted to a string that includesobject Object and then the number 3 which is the variable from aNumber up here.So using modification assignment operators with objects and arrays andother reference variables is really not recommended.The results may not be what you expect.Limit your use of this modification assignment operatorsto primitive variables.

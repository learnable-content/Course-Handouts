Null and Undefined Types

Two of the critical values to know about for variables are null and undefined.We've encountered both of these already, butlets get into a little more detail about what they are and how they work.First of all, undefined variables are variables that have been declared but
Undefined Variables

have not yet been set to a value.When a variable has not yet been defined, undefined is actuallythe type of that variable, and the boolean value of an undefined variable is false.Let me show you how that works.So lets create a new variable.And we're going to call this new variable.And let's do a console.log of the type of this new variableusing the type of operator and the optional parentheses.And if we go over here andrun that, you'll see that the type of an undefined variable is actually undefined.And this makes sense, because JavaScript assigns types to variablesbased on the value of their content, and an undefined variable has no content yet.Now lets go back and confirm the boolean value.So lets console.log the boolean of the new variable.And if we go over here and clear, and then run again, we'll see that the booleanvalue of a declared variable that has not yet been defined is false.Variables that have not yet had a value assigned to them are undefined, butvariables can also have another value called null.
Null Variables

Setting a variable to null unsets its value sothat it essentially stops existing.And because null is an unknown value,JavaScript reports the type of a null variable as object.Let me show you how that works.So lets create a new variable.We're going to call it newVariable, and let's set it to 1.Now, if we console.log the type ofnewVariable, and go over here and run that,you'll see that the type of newVariable, as we would expect, is a number.Now let's go back and console.log the boolean of newVariable.And because newVariable is set to 1, andwe know that the boolean value of a number other than 0 is always true,if we run this, we'll see that the boolean value of newVariable is true.But now let's set newVariable to null.Now let's copy and paste.We're going to console.log the type of newVariable,and console.log the boolean of newVariable.And let's clear, and run again.And now you can see that the type of newVariable,since it's been set to null, becomes object.And the boolean value of newVariable, since it's been set to null, is false.Null variables are considered false when trying to determine their boolean value.But does JavaScript consider null and undefined to be the same?
Null and Undefined - Not Exact Matches

Null and undefined are treated as matches when you're doing comparisons, butthey're not exact matches.Let me demonstrate that.Let's create a variable, and we're going to call it notInitialized.And we're not going to set it to any value.And let's create another variable, and we're going to call it setToNull.And we're going to assign it the value null.Now, let's console.log the comparison betweennotInitialized and setToNull using two equals signs.And let's console.log the comparison between notInitialized andsetToNull using three equals signs.Now if we go over here and run this, we'll see that when coerced to be the same type,undefined variables andvariables that have been set to null are considered to be the same.But, when using three equal signs,undefined variables are not the same type as variables that have been set to null,and the boolean value is false for that comparison.Knowing the difference between these return values, and how JavaScript treatsthem when comparing them, is going to come in handy when you're confronted with a bugthat you don't understand and you're trying to figure out whya comparison is coming back different from the way that you would expect it to.

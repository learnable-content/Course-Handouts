Sometimes the information you want,
Logical Operators

is how multiple boolean values relate to each other, and in that case it'sconvenient to be able to use logical operator to separate these boolean values.
Logical "And" Operator

The first logical operator I'm going to introduce you to is the and operator, andan and operator is represented by two ampersands next to each other.If you create an expression comparing multiple valuesseparated by double ampersands, you'll get the value trueonly if all of the values inside of that expression are true.If there are no Booleans in the comparisons,the return value will be the last true value.And that might sound a little bit complex.But let me show it to you, and I think you'll understand.We're going to create some variables.We're going to make a truth variable, which we're going to set to true.And we're going to make a falsehood variable,which we're going to set to false.We're also going to create a firstWord variable,which we're going to set to Hello.And a secondWord variable which we're going to set to world.Now let's console.log.Truth, with a double ampersand, truth.Now, this double ampersand operator is the And operator, andit will only return true if everything here is true.And in this case we know that truth is true, and we know that truth is true.So, if we Clear and Run.The result of this is going to be true,which is that the truth && truth are both true.On the other hand, if we console.log(truth)with a double ampersand and falsehood.And we clear and run that.We get false.because only one of these two is actually returning the value of true.If any value in a comparison separated by ampersands returns the value of false,then the return value will always be false.And the comparisons don't have to be between variables that have been set toBoolean values.We can also console.log, the comparisonbetween 3 is less than 4, which we know to be true.And then use the double ampersand for the and.And maybe Apple, the string,is less than Banana, the string, which is also true.If we clear and run that, we'll see that we get again the value true,because three is less than four and Apple is less than Banana.Each one of these evaluates to a Boolean true.The && and operator shows the value true, as a result.Now we've discussed before that string values that are not empty evaluate true.So, if we console.log.(firstWord && secondWord).What do you think we're going to get?Aha!In this case, we actually get the value World,which is the value of the last true string inside of the comparison.This is the equivalent of saying true and also telling us what the last value is.If you're doing this comparison to determine whether the value is true, andthe result you get is a string that has content,that equates in JavaScript to a value of true.And if we reverse the order here, andwe console.log secondWord and firstWord.And we clear andrun again, we can demonstrate that what gets returned from this kind of comparisonis the last true value that was not a boolean from the comparison aslong as both of the elements on both sides of the double ampersand evaluate as true.If we console.log falsehood and first word,and clear and run again we just get the value false.And that's because both of the values on both sides of the double ampersand have toevaluate as true to get anything but false from a double ampersand comparator.Logical and
Logical "Or" Operator

isn't the only logical comparator that's available to you in JavaScript.There's also a logical or.And with a Logical Or, multiple values that are separated by double pipeswill return true if any of those values is true.And with the double pipe or comparator, if there are no other true values,the first true value will be returned.And again, it's better to visualize this by seeing some code.So let me show you.We're going to start with the same four variables that we had before, andlet's console.logfalsehood or falsehood.And this character here is using double pipes, and the pipe is frequentlyfound to the far right of the keyboard usually above the return or enter key.So what we’re seeing here is either falsehood orfalsehood is true then you should return true.So let’s clear and run.Now clearly falsehood andfalsehood are both false, so we get a return value of false.But if we console.log(truth|| falsehood), and we clear and run, in that case we get true.Because one of the values is true.Now remember with a double ampersand both of the values had to be true in order toget a true result.With the double pipe or comparatoronly one of those true values has to be true in order to get a true result.Once again, you can also console.log expressions to compare them.And so if we console.log((3< 4) || "Banana" > "Apple")And we put that in parentheses.And we clear and run that.We get true because three is less than four, and that's going tobe evaluated as true regardless of whether banana is actually greater than apple.And in fact, for efficiency,JavaScript won't even bother checking the value of banana andcompare it to apple if it knows that three is less than four comes back as true.This can be useful if you're ever doing complex operations andyou want to save some time.Put the simplest ones that you can compare at the beginning of the comparator.And then the other ones won't even be bothered with.Now you'll remember that the boolean value of a string is true.So if we console.log, first word, orsecond word, and we clear and re-run.The end result is hello.And in this case, it's the first word.If you remember, when we console.log firstWord with a double ampersandwith secondWord, the result of that was the secondWord, world.And if we do that backwards, console.logsecondWord, with a double pipe, firstWord.And we clear and run.As you might expect, the word the first true value that showed up with the Oris returned.And finally,only one of these values needs to be true in order to get a positive result.So let's console.log(falsehood || firstWord).And if we Clear and Run that.We'll see that the result is once again the first true value that was encountered.Which was firstWord, hello.Logical And and Logical Or will get you through a lot of situations.
Logical "Not" Operator

But you can also use a Logical Not in order toinvert the value of an expression being compared.A single exclamation mark will negate the Boolean value of a variable oran expression.And that's easy to demonstrate.We'll start with just two variables, truth and falsehood.And let's console.log(truth).But, let's put an exclamation mark in front of it.And if we run that, we'll see that the logical not of truth is false.And of course, if we console.log the logical not of falsehood,and clear and run that we get true.And you can apply this to expressions as well, so if we console.log, not,and three is less than 4,and we clear and run that, we'll see that that's false,because the opposite of 3 is less than 4 is false.In fact, 3 is less than 4, which would be true.And you can use this in more complex comparisons as well.So for example the logical not of 3 is less than 4 couldbe compared to the logicalnot of banana is less than apple.And if we clear and run thatwe'll see that we get a result of true because inverting both of these allowsthe true value of the one that's inverted to come through with a Logical Or.That shows you how to use Logical Not with Booleans andexpressions but let me show you how to use Logical Not with Primitive Variables.
Logical "Not" for Primitive Variables

The Boolean value of any non-empty and non-zero String.Or any number other than zero with Not is considered false.The Boolean value of an empty string, a zero number, or a null orundefined variable with a logical Not is considered true.And I can demonstrate that.Let's create a few variables.Create a variable called word, and set it to the value Hello.I'm going to create a variable called empty and set that to an empty string.Lets create a variable called negative, and we're going to set that negative 10.Going to create a variable called zero which will set to zero andwe'll create a variable called no value which will set to no.And we'll create a variable called notDefined.And this one we're notgoing to define at all.So that's console.log, not word.And if we run that,we'll get a syntax error telling us that there's an unexpected token,and that's because I put an equals sign here instead of a negative sign.But, if we Clear and Run that, we'll get a false, andthat's because the Boolean value of a string with contents is always true, sothe Boolean value of not a string with contents is considered false.Similarly, if we console.log(!empty).And we clear and run that.We get true because the boolean value of an empty string is false.So the boolean value of not an empty string is true.console.log of not negative gives us false as well,because even though negative is a negative number,we know that negative numbers or positive numbers,any number other than zero is considered true in a Boolean sense, so !negative.Would also be considered false.But console.log of!zero, knowing that zero is considered false in a boolean context,!zero would be considered true.And again knowing that the boolean value of a null variable is considered falseif we console.log notof nullValue and clear and run that, we get true.And console.log not of notDefined.Again we clear and run and we get true.So you can use the logical not for primitive variablesto pull out the boolean value of the opposite of that variable.
Deriving a Boolean Value

But you can also derive the Boolean value of a variablesimply by using two exclamation marks.Essentially, you're doing not, not.That'll convert any primitive value to its Boolean equivalent.The boolean value of non-empty and non-zero strings ornumbers is true, and the boolean value of an empty string, or zero value,or a no or undefined variable is false, and I can demonstrate that as well.Using the exact same example, if we just add another exclamation markto all of these nots, they become not not.And what they do is simply return the boolean value of each of these variables.So let's clear andrun that and what we see is the boolean value of a string is true.The boolean value of an empty string is false.The boolean value of a negative number is truebecause it's true of any number other than zero.The boolean value of zero is false.The boolean value of null is false, andthe boolean value of an undefined variable is false.This trick with the double exclamation marks is convenient to know aboutwhen you need to figure out the boolean value of a given variable or value.
Logic Precedence

When you're using the logical comparison operators,it's important to note the precedence in which they're executed.Basically all you need to know is that evaluation for a series of logicaloperators within a single expression, is always done from left to right.And I can show that with an example.We'll start with two simple variables.Truth, which is set to true, and falsehood, which is set to false.So if we do a console.log oftruth & truth & truth, the first thingthat's going to happen is we're going to evaluate whether the first value is true.Then we're going to use this logical And operator andevaluate whether both the first and the second values are true.Then we'll get to the second logical and operator andthat's going to compare whether everything before it results in true andcompare that to this and see whether that upset also results in true.And if we clear and run that of course we get the value true.Because all of these evaluate to true.But if we copy and paste that.And change the middle one to falsehood, what's going to happen now is that truthwhat is going to happen now is that truth and falsehood are going to be compared.And because falsehood is going to come back as false ortruth is going to come back as true.The second logical andoperator and this particular value of truth, are never going to be evaluated.We've already determined that the value inside of this expression is false.So, if we clear and run again, we'll get the return value of "false" andwe never even bothered to figure out whether it was compared over here.Similarly, if we copy this andchange those And operators to Or operators,We're going to do a comparison showing whether truth or falsehood is true.And in this case, we're going to get the result of true.And because this second comparison operator is an Or.And we know that the value in front of it evaluates to true,we won't need to bother with this.We already know that we have a true value.So if we clear and run, we'll get the value true from JavaScript.Now if we copy and paste this, and we change just the first operator to a &&,we're going to do the calculations slightly differently.We're going to see truth here, and then a &&, and then we've got falsehood or truth.Which evaluates to true so we have truth on one side and we have falsehood ortruth on the other side.So if we run that we see that we get the output of true forthis evaluation and let's copy and paste that put it down here andlet's reverse the order with these operators.So truth or falsehood and truth.If we clear and run that, we'll see that we still get a true value,because truth or falsehood and truth both evaluate to be true.But lets copy and paste this last one, andin this case we're going to change the last value from truth to falsehood.And the operation is going to be calculated from left to right.So, because the truth is in there, if we run this,we'll see the truth, or whatever comes after it, is going to evaluate as true.But if we copy and paste this, and switch the order of the logical operators sothat the first one is a logical And, and the second one is a logical Or, andwe clear and run again, we'll get false because truth and falsehood is false.Falsehood or falsehood is also false.Get comfortable with some of these logic operators andfiguring out the precedence of the calculations.When you experiment with them a little bit you're going to get familiarwith how they work.

Comparison Operators

We've gone through a number of operators that change the value of variables.But there are also operators that can be used to compare variables andgenerate a Boolean value based on the relationship between variables.
Equality for Primitive Variables

We've seen a couple of examples where we've tested the equality ofprimitive variables to see if they were the same.And the question when dealing with primitive variablesis whether the value of the variables is the same.Let me show you some examples of basic values comparisons forprimitive variables.Now, we're going to setup some variables to do some comparison tests.We're going to make a firstNumber variable.We're going to set that to 5.And we're going to make a secondNumber variable.We're going to set that to 10.We're to make a firstWord variable, I'm going to set that to "hello",and we're going to make a secondWord variable andwe're going to set that to" world".Now, if we console.log(firstNumber == firstNumber).And we run that, we'll see of course we get the value true.Because first number is equal to first number.And remember, we're using the comparison operator with two equal signsto say that the two values on either side of this operator have the same value.If we console.logfirstNumber has the same value as 5 which isthe value contained in firstNumber and we run that, we'll see that we also get true.And of course, if we console.log(firstNumber== secondNumber), and we Clear and Run that.In that case we get false and that's because firstNumber andsecondNumber don't contain the same value.Now, similarly with strings,if we console.log firstWord as the same value asfirstWord, and we Clear and Run that.We get true because firstWord does have the same value as firstWord.If we console.log firstWord has the same value as the stringhello, we Clear and Run that.Again, it's true because hello is the value of the content of firstWord.And if we console.log firstWord, has the samevalue as secondWord and we Clear and Run that.Of course, we get false because firstWord has hello,secondWord has word, and those are not the same values.And that exercise might have seemed straight forward to you.In fact, it might not have seemed it was worth going through at all.But the reason we went through that is because equality for primitive variables
Equality for Reference Variables

and equality for reference variables is treated differently in JavaScript.Reference variables are not considered equal if they don't both referencethe same object in memory.And as we've discussed primitive variables such as strings andnumbers are compared by value while reference variables such as objects andarrays are compared by their location in memory.Let me show you a similar set of comparisons using reference variables.See you can see the difference.Now, we're going to set up a couple of variables.We're going to make var arr1 for an array andwe're going to set that to an array of [1,2] and we're going to copy andpaste this andwe're going to create a variable called r2 which has the same value.Similarly, we're going to create a var obj1 and we're going to set that toan object containing color as key and red as a value.And again, we're going to copy and paste this and createobj2 which also has a color red inside of an object as value.Now, if we console.log(arr1 ==arr1) with the double equal sign,and we run that, we'll see that it's true.JavaScript thinks that arr1 the arrayis the same as arr1 the array because they both reference the same place in memory.But what if we console.log arr1 is the same asan array containing [1,2] which we know is the value contained inside of r1.If we go over here and Clear andRun again, we see that according to JavaScript that's false.That's because this array that we just created as part of this comparison,with the 1 and the 2 in it, is not in the same location of memory as the location inmemory is arr1 is storing it's value.Even though the values are the same.Similarly if we console.logarr1 is equivalent to arr2 andwe Clear and Run again.We'll still see that that's false.They may both contain the same value but the values are not stored in the samelocation in memory so JavaScript doesn't consider them the same.On the other hand, if we take arr2 and we set it to arr1.And then, we repeat that same comparison that we just did, comparing arr1 and arr2.If we Clear and Run again, we'll see that now,JavaScript considers those two arrays to be the same andthat's because we've set arr2 to reference the same location in memory as arr1.We can do the same thing with these objects.Let's console.log Obj1is the same as obj1.And if we Clear and Run, we'll see that JavaScriptrecognizes that obj1 is of course the same as obj1.But if we console.log obj1 is the same as the valuethat stored in obj1 which is an object with color of red.We Clear and Run, as we would expect, JavaScript considers that comparisonto be false because this isn't the same location in memory that obj1 is using.Similarly, if we console.log obj1 is the sameas obj2 which has the same value as obj1,and we Clear and Run again, we get a false andthat's because they're not using the same location in memory.But if we perform that operation to set obj2 = obj1basically telling them to use the same location in memory.And then we copy and paste this comparison between obj1 and obj2.And we clear and run again.You'll see that that makes JavaScript consider these two objects to be equal,using this double equals comparison operator.That's why it's important to keep in mind the differences betweenprimitive variables and reference variables.When doing comparisons.
Comparing Variables of Different Types

You can also compare variable of different types.In most cases, variables of different typeswill be converted to a common type first, before the comparison is done.So for example,strings might be converted to numbers, Booleans will be converted to numbers.And objects will use the two string method of the objectto convert them to strings before doing a comparison.Let me show you how that works.So we're going to create five variables.We're going to create one called aNumber.We're going to set that to the number 5.And we're going to create a variable called aString, andwe're going to set that to a string containing the number 5.Let's create a variable called truth, I'm going to set that to true,the boolean value.going to create a variable called falsehood,We're going to set that to false, also a boolean value.And we're going to create a variable called anObject, andwe're going to set that to an object containing the pair of color red.Now, let's console.log aNumberhas the same value as aString.When we go over here and run this, we'll see that according to JavaScript, usingthe double equals comparison, aNumber is the same as aString in this case.Because aNumber contains the number 5, and a string contains the string value 5.The two were coerced to be the same variable type.And because the string could be converted to a number,it was possible to say that the values actually matched.We can also console.log truth is the same as the number 1.And if we clear and run this again.We'll see that according to JavaScript the number 1,and the coerced numerical value of truth are the same.As you remember from an earlier lesson, when you convert a booleanvalue to a number, it's either a one for for truth, or zero for falsehood.And we can confirm that by doing console.log(falsehood == 0).And if we Clear and Run that.We'll also get true for that.Because falsehood and 0 are considered equivalent.But when we compare an object to a string, that object is converted to a string,as we mentioned, using the two-string method.Lets console.log whatanObject.toString with parentheses because it's a method.What does that give us?When you convert this object to a string,you don't get the contents of the object, you get object.Object.So, if we take that, copy it,go over here, and re-console.log.That string is the same as an object.When we clear and run again, what we should see is that, yes,JavaScript does do the conversion.And considers an object to be the equivalent of that string,object Object, when doing this comparison with the double equals operator.Once you know what to expect, you can figure out what the comparison is going toyield when comparing variables of different types.
Strict Equality

but you can also force JavaScript not to convert types.We've introduced this Strict Equality operator before.And the Strict Equality operator uses three equal signsto determine whether both the value, and the type of two variables are the same.And just to remind you how that works, I'll show you again.We're going to start with two of the variables that we just defined.Let's console.log aNumber is equivalentto aString using the double equals sign.And we're going to console.log aNumberis equal to aString using the triple equals sign.Now the triple equals sign, as we mentioned, will force the comparison notto convert the variables to the same type before comparing them.So if we run this we'll see that with two equals signs, aNumber andaString do contain the same value.But with three equals signs, aNumber and aString are obviously not the same.Because one of them is a string, and one of them is a number.As a JavaScript programmer, you might find it's much more convenientto use the three equal signs, rather than the two equal signs in most cases.Because that way you'll know that the type, andthe value are both being compared.And you can trust the result that you're getting shows that the two variables orvalues really are the same.You can also test inequality with JavaScript.
Inequality

And again, when you're doing inequality comparisons,the values will be converted before the comparison is done.JavaScript supports both loose and strict inequality, andI'll show you the difference.Let's set up a few variables.We're going to make a firstNumber, we're going to set that to 5.We're going to make a secondNumber, we're going to set that to 10.Let's create a variable called numberString.We're going to set that to A string containing the number 5.Now let's create a variable called firstWord, and set that to hello.And a variable called secondWord.We're going to set that to world.Now, if we console.log firstNumberDoes not equal secondNumber.And we're using the Exclamation mark equals operator,which says these two are not equal.And we run that, we'll see that it's true.firstNumber and secondNumber are not equal to each other.And if we console.log(firstNumber != 5,and in this case firstNumber does equal the value 5.If we clear and run that we'll see that that's false.The not equals operator does do the comparison by value, andsays Is firstNumber does not equal the value 5.And if we do console.log(firstNumber !=numberString), and we clear and run that.We'll see that again JavaScript thinks that that's false.Because this comparison operator, which uses an exclamation mark anda single equals sign, converts firstNumber and numberString to the same type,compares them, sees that they actually are the same.So saying that they're not the same is false.But, if we console.log(firstNumberis not exactly the same as numberString.Using an exclamation mark and two equal signs.And we clear and run again.We'll see that in this case.This is true because firstNumber and numberString may be the same if they'reconverted to the same type, but they're not the same type.So, using !==, preserves the type when doing the comparison.And just to complete our example for strings, if we console.log(firstWord != secondWord), and we Clear and Run.We find that, that's true, firstWord and secondWord are not equal.But if we console.log (firstWord != "Hello"), and we Clear and Run.We'll see that, that's false because firstWord is a primitive variable,a string, and it is equivalent by value to the string "Hello".Once again, using the exact comparison operator with the two equal signsis probably going to be more effective most cases, so that you know forsure what you're comparing.
Relation for Number Variables

Frequently, you're going to want to compare number variables to see whichnumber is larger or smaller than another.JavaScript supports greater than, greater than or equals to, less than, andless than equals to operators, and I'll show you quickly how those work.Let's create three variables.FirstNumber, which we'll set to 5.A secondNumber, which we'll set to 10, anda numberString which we'll set to a string containing the value "5".Now, if we console.log(firstNumber > secondNumber).And we Run that, we'll see that we get false, because 5 is not greater than 10.However, if we console.log(firstNumber< secondNumber).And we Clear and Run that, we'll see that that's true.The less than operator recognizes that 5 less than 10.And if we console.log(firstNumber >=) the value 5,and we Clear and Run that, we'll see that that's true,because this greater than or equals to operatorcompares the two by value, and because firstNumber andthe number 5 are equal the result of that comparison is true.Now, let's compare firstNumber and numberString.Let's console.log(firstNumber<= numberString).And if we Clear and Run that, we'll see that JavaScript let's us do that.The numberString and firstNumber are coerced to be the same type by thisless than or equals to operator, and then the comparison is done.And because firstNumber is equal to the coerced value of numberString,which is 5, the result that we get is true.That works when we're doing the comparison either way, because less than or equal to,or greater than or equal to are the same when the value is the same.And just to round out the example,we can console.log(secondNumber > firstNumber).And if we Clear and Run that, we'll see that that also comes out as true.Comparing numerical values is pretty straightforward, butyou can also do comparisons for string variables.And strings are compared, letter by letter,in order by the position of each letter in the alphabet.And in the case of capital and lowercase letters,capital letters actually have a lower value than lower case letters, andthat's because of the ASCII numbering system that's usedto calculate the position in the alphabet of each character.So, let me show you some examples of how that works.So, we're going to create four variables.First we're going to create firstWord,which is "Hello" with a capital H,and second "World",which is world with capital W.Let's make a var thirdWord, we're going to setthat to "hello" in lower case, and,a fourthWord, which we're going to set to "help", also in lower case.Now, if we console.log(firstWord is > secondWord),how does that comparison get calculated?We can see that firstWord is not greater than secondWord, according to JavaScript.If we go letter by letter,we can see that the letter H is lower in the alphabet than the letter W.And since H and W are the first letters of these strings,the comparison between them determines the firstWord is not greater than secondWord.If we Copy and Paste this, and switch the comparison operator, sothat we're doing a less than.We Clear and Run, we'll see that yes, firstWord is less than secondWord.We can also prove That first wordIs being compared by value to the string "Hello".And if we use the greater than or equal to comparator, or less than or equal to forthat matter, we'll get the value of true, because firstWord's value andthe string "Hello's" value are the same.Interestingly, if we console.log the comparisonbetween (firstWord > thirdWord).Both of these words are hello, but firstWord is "Hello" with an upper caseletter, and thirdWord is "hello" starting with a lower case letter.If we Clear and Run this, we'll see that it's false.FirstWord with an uppercase letter is not greater than thirdWord,which has all lowercase letters.And if we Copy and Paste this, and change the direction of the comparison operator,and Run it again, we'll see that thirdWord, the word "hello" with alllowercase is actually considered greater than firstWord.We'll see that firstWord is actually considered less than thirdWord, andI just noticed a typo, I wanted fourth not fourt.So, [LAUGH] let's do a comparison between,we do a console.log between(thirdWord > fourthWord).And if we Clear andRun this, we'll see that thirdWord is not considered greater than fourthWord.And that's because if you go letter by letter, h-e-l-l is consideredlower than h-e-l-p, because p is higher in the alphabet than l is.The formula for calculating relations with string variables is to go letter by letterthrough the string until you get to letters that are different, andas soon as you do, that's where you do the comparison.And if the letter is capital,it's considered lower than the exact same letter as a lower case.

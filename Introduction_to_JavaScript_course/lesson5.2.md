Introduction

Using functions to give a name to a block of statements so that you canexecute them whenever you want to, adds incredible power to your programming.But you can also pass values to a function using function arguments.
Passing Arguments to Functions

Function arguments let you take a value that you want to use inside of thatfunction, and pass it in so that you can manipulate it.Variables to be used by a function can be passed as argumentsbetween the parentheses that you use when you're calling and executing a function.And let me show you a quick example just so you understand.When you define a function,you don't define it around the specific variables that exist.You define it in the abstract, using it's own internal set of variables.For example, if we have a color variable and we set that to red.And we want to create a function that can show the value of a string,such as this color variable.We could create a function called showItem.And inside of the parentheses of our definition forthis function, we can create a local variable called item.Then we'll create a block of statements that can be executed on item.In this case we're going to console.log(item).And that's our entire function.Now, we can do showItem(color).And if we run that,we see that showItem(color) performs a console.log on color.What we've done is we've created a function that's looking for a variable,and then it's going to perform a console.log on that variable.This function uses the name, item for the parameter that we're passing in.And it executes it's statements on the local item variable.And as a result, when we do a showItem, andwe pass in the variable color, it treats color as item.Does a console.log on color,which is it's local version of item, and gives us the value red.Knowing how to pass arguments to a function,makes functions even more powerful.
Pass Multiple Named Arguments

And you can pass multiple named arguments to any function.The arguments that you pass to a function can be of any variable type.And you refer to them by their parameter namewhen you're writing the definition of the function.When you're writing the statements that go in the code block that the functionexecutes.Let me show you a little bit more detail how that works.Let's define a function, and we're going to call it greeter.and in the function we're going to be using 2 local variables, a string andan array.So let's call those variables str and arr.To process str and arr, we're going to create a block of statements.And what we're going to want to do is iterate through all of the variables inarr, and use the str value to create sentences for each one.So since we're going to be doing an iteration,let's create a local variable called counter that we can use for our for loop.So let's make a for loop.And set our initial state of counter get zero.And make sure that counter in the final state is less than arr.length.And every time that the loop iterates, we're going to do counter++.We've seen these before.Let's create a block of statements, andin this case the block is just going to consist of one console.log statement.We're going to console.log whatever the value of the string is,concatenated with string that's a space, andthen concatenated with the current index value of arr.So that would be arr sub counter.And what we have now is a function that can take any string, and any array andoutput the string with a space and then each value of the array sequentially.So, for example, if we want to create a variable called word, and set it to hello.And we want to create another variable called animals.And we're going to set that to an array of cat, dog,and bird.Now we can use our greeter function with both of those variables and call greeter.And passing in word as the string, and animals as the array.And if we clear and run,what we're going to get is "Hello cat", "Hello dog", "Hello bird".The first time that it runs.The function greeter uses the word string, and the animals array, andgoes through a for loop starting from zero to the length of the array.Which in this case since it's animals it's three.It does a console.log of hello and a space.And then the zero index value of array.Which is the zero index value of animals, which is cat.The second time the index is one and it says "Hello dog".Because dog is the second item in array at index one.And the third time "Hello bird",because bird is the third item at index two of the array.And then the function is done then it exits.It's worth experimenting a little bit with some of these.Just so that you get familiar with the concept that the arguments that you'recreating when you define greater function, and the parameters you're passing in whenyou call the greater function, relate to each other directly.
Design and Name for Reuse

When creating a function, it's important to design and name your function sothat it can be reusable in multiple contexts.Ideally a function should be very flexible.It should be reusable, and it should be independent of a specific context.It should be able to be picked up and used in different places, conveniently.And name functions so that they can support flexible applications.In our case, we named our last function greeter, and it used any string andany set of arrays, and created brand new greeting every single time.If we passed it a different set of variables,it would still function the way we would expect.Let me show you how this function can be used in multiple ways.Let's create another couple of variables.We're going to create a variable called salutation,and we're going to set that to goodbye.And let's create another array.We're just going to call it target.And let's set that to sun, and moon.Now greeter of word and animals, of course, says hello cat, dog and bird.We can also do greeter of salutation target.And if we clear and run now, we'll see that the very same greeter functionthat said, hello, cat, hello, dog, hello, bird.Can also be used to say, goodbye sun, goodbye moon.And, in fact we can use greeter to say helloto both the sun and the moon, by passing word and target.If we clear and run again, we'll see hello sun, hello moon.We've created our function in such a way that it can be used in different contextsdepending on which variables we pass to it, and still be useful.
Functions Can Call Functions

Functions can also call other functions, and this is convenient.Because you can treat your functions just like native functions in JavaScript, anduse them just like any other JavaScript keyword.Imagine we wanted a JavaScript function that could take a stringwith multiple words in it, and return it to us in title case.That would be each word in the string, with the first letter capitalized.And otherwise the string remains the same.We have to do a couple of things to that string.The first thing we'd have to do is split the string into separate substrings foreach word.Then we'd have to go through each word, capitalize the first letter of that word.And then join the string back together with spaces, and return the value.Now, we've seen how to do all of those different pieces.But with functions, we can actually make useful little toolsthat will help us make that more efficient.Let me give you a quick example.Let's start by trying to create a function called, title case.And it's going to take a string.Now the first thing we're going to do is create our block of statements.And we'd like to split the string based on where the spaces are between the words.Now we've seen before how to do that.So let's create a local variable.And we're going to call it strArray, andwe're going to set it to str.split, on every space.In order to test this,why don't we create a string that we're going to use for testing?So var testString gets hello world.And let'sconsole.log(titleCase(testString)).And if we clear and run that.We see that we get undefined, andthat's because we haven't defined a return value for this function yet.So, let's return strArray for now.And if we clear and run that.We can see that we get the array hello world,proving that strArray is actually string, split at the spaces.Now we'd like to iterate through that array that we just created.So we're going to need a counter variable first of all,and just call this counter for now.And let's create a for loop.And for counter is equal to zero.Counter, in the terminal case, is less than strArray.length.And counter++ iterates through each of the loops of the array.Will create a block of statements, and then that block,what we're going to want to do is capitalize each item in strArray.So, we've got strArray[counter], andwe're going to set it to a value.And what we want to set it to isa capitalized version of the original string from the array.But although JavaScript has a native function that can capitalizeall of the letters in the string, JavaScript does not have a native functionthat will only capitalize the first letter of a string.We need to create one of those ourselves.And we're going to call our own function capitalize.We haven't defined it yet, but we know we're going to create it.So we're going to set the value of each element instrArray to capitalize of strArray.Sub counter.And at the moment, we've created some illegal code.If we were to try to run this right now, if we clear and run,we would get an error.And the reason is, ReferenceError: capitalize is not defined.But we can take care of that.Lets define another function, capitalize.And capitalize is going to take its own string, andit's going to execute a block of statements on that string.And what we want to do with this string, is take just the first letter,capitalize it, and then add all of the rest of the letters for that string.And this we'll be doing for each word in our array.So, let's do this by creating an array, and we'll create that with a variable.And we're just going to call it result.We're going to set it to an empty array.Now to create the first value in result, we're going to set resultsub zero, is going to be set to str.And then we're going to use one of the string methods of JavaScript.Which will let us isolate the first character in the string.So, what we'd use is a dot and call the charAt method.And we're going to take the character at position zero in the string.And we can chain our methods here.And send a string method of toUpperCase on this first letter.And now the first value in the result array is going to bethe first letter of our string set to upper case.And we want to create a second item in our result arraythat's going to be all of the rest of the characters in our string.So lets set result[1]to string.substringstarting at character one.Now we need to return a result from capitalize.And in this case the result we want is going to be both of the items inthe result array joined together into a string, with no spaces between them.And we know how to do that to arrays.We've seen this before.So let's return...Result, use the join method of arrays.And join using an empty string that has no spaces in it.And if we now clear and run this, we see that what we're getting back from ourtitle titleCase is the array, strArray.But both of the words in strArray have been capitalized properly.All we need to do now is change our return on titleCase,so that it does the same type of join that we did on capitalize.So what we want to do is join strArray using the join method.And in this case, we too want a space between the elements.Because when we did the split, we split by removing spaces.So when we do the join in this case, we want to replace the spaces.So now if we clear and run again, we get Hello World in title case.We can use our new title case function on any string that we want.For example we can console.log(titleCase)of "this is a title".Without even defining a variable.And if we clear and run that, we'll see that all of the words in this is a title,are now being correctly capitalized the way that you'd them in a title.What we've shown here is that we can create small modular functions.That perform very specific tasks named appropriately.And we can use one function to call another function, andget a more complex result out of much simpler modular pieces.

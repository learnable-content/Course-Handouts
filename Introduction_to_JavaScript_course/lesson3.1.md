Introduction to Operators

Welcome back to Introduction to Programming In JavaScript.This is Lesson Three, and this time I'm going to talk to you about operators.
Operators Make Variables Do Things

Operators are how you make variables do things in JavaScript.And the operators are the symbols that show what's going to happen toeach variable or value in the statement.Let me give you a couple of examples, just sothat you're clear on what I'm talking about.So imagine I'm going to create a couple of variables.It's called var smallNumber,going to set it equal to 2, and var bigNumber,and we're going to set it equal to 2000.Now there are operators already in these statements.In this case we're using the assignment operator.And that's this equal sign right here in both of these statements.In this case, the operator is telling the variable to set itself to the value onthe other side of the operator.Now, let's do a console.log ofsmallNumber plus bigNumber.And we've been doing this long enough,you know what the result of that is going to be if we Clear and Run.It's going to be 2002.But what I want to point out to you is that in this case,there's another operator.This is the plus sign, andthis plus sign is telling JavaScript to add smallNumber and bigNumber together.Let me give you another example.Let's console.log smallNumberis less than bigNumber.And let's Clear and Run again.And of course smallNumber, 2, is less than bigNumber, 2000, so the result is true.And the operator in the case is this less than sign, which creates a Booleanout of the comparison between smallNumber and bigNumber.Working with operators may seem sointuitive that you might have just skipped over thinking about them.But it's important to be conscious of what an operator is andhow it works in order to be effective in using them in JavaScript.One of the reasons you need to know about operators, is because some of them behave
Operators Respond to Types

differently depending on the type of the variable that you're using them with.The same operator can do different things to variables and values of differenttypes, and if you're not expecting it, it can be a bit of a surprise.Let me show you some examples.Let's create a couple of new string variables.Let's make a variable called firstWord.We're going to set it to "Hello" andlet's make a variable, secondWord.We're going to set it to "World".Now, let's console.log,firstWord, plus a string witha space, plus secondWord.And, if we go over here and run that, we'll see that we get a new string asthe result of that operation, which is "Hello World".In this case, the plus operator that we used formathematical addition with numbers, is being used for concatenation with strings.Knowing which operators you can use with which variable types, andhow they're going to affect those variable types is goingto be helpful in avoiding problems when you're working with JavaScript.
JavaScript is Loosely Typed

The reason that it's important to keep track of this is that JavaScriptis loosely typed.What that means is that variables as we've seen are declared without a type.Variables can hold data of any type, anda single variable can actually hold different data types at different times.And that's why we have to pay attention to what our variable typesare as we perform operations on them.The operation we perform may do something different,depending on the type of variable.Type coercion can actually change the type of a variable.So the results can be surprising if you don't know what the rules are andwhat to expect.Let me show you an example of one of the tricky situations you can get intojust with addition.Let's create a variable.We're going to call it letter andwe're going to set it to the string capital letter A.Let's create a variable, andwe're going to call it number and we're going to set it to the number 1.Now if we console.lognumber plus number, we know that over here we'regoing to get 2 because it's mathematically adding number and number.Similarly, if we console.log letter concatenated with letter.We clear and run again, we're going to get AA.It's simply going to duplicate the value andcreate a new string out of those two copies.But what if we try to use this operator to combine a string and a number?Let's do console.log letter plus number.If we go over here and clear and run again,we'll see that we get the letter and the number represented together as a string.Similarly if we console.log number plus letter, and we clear andrerun again, we get another string, which is the number and the letter.Now remember, when we performed mathematical operations on strings before,we got JavaScript returning Not-a-Number as a result.In this case, JavaScript is coercing our number into a string andthen performing the appropriate string concatenation method.And if we console.log(letter + letter + number),and we clear and we run again, we still get the sameconcatenation of two A's and the number one.Two strings and the number all coursed into strings and concatenated together.But let me show you the tricky part.What if we console.log(number + number + letter)?What do you think we're going to get now?Surprisingly, we get 2A.Now, why does this happen?This is because of the order in which JavaScript forms the concatenation andaddition operations.The first thing JavaScript does is add together the two numbers.And then it concatenates the result of adding those two numbers together,as a string with letter and gives us a 2A.That probably wasn't the result that you were expectingbased on what we had seen already.But it makes perfect sense once you understand how JavaScript treats itsoperators, how the operators interact with variable types,and what the precedence of operations is, in JavaScript.

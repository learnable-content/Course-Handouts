Block Statements

Welcome back.This is lesson four in the Introduction to Programming in JavaScript,and I'm going to be going over block statements.Which we covered briefly in an earlier lesson, but this time we're going to goa little deeper into how they work and why you'd need to use them.Now, we've already covered what a statement is.
What is a Statement?

Statements are sets of instructions that tell the computer how to performan action.And a typical statement in JavaScript usually begins with a keyword ora variable.A statement always ends with a semicolon.Statements in JavaScript are executed sequentially, for the most part.And as I've mentioned, statements may be grouped in a block with curly braces.But why would you want group statements?
Why Group Statements?

A program may need to repeat the same set of steps over and over again.Each one of those steps could be a separate statement, andby grouping those statements together, you can tell the program to consider thatparticular group of statements as a single block and treat them consistently.So, when would a program need to repeat a set of statements?Well, let me give you an example of a situation you might encounter.So, let's find a variable.And it's going to be a set of colors.And we're going to make it an array.And inside of there, we're going to put red, green, and blue.And then we're going to make another variable andit's going to be a question that we might want to ask our users.And let's set that question to, let's see.Question, let's set it to, do you like the color?And then use the concatenation and let's and then use the concatenationoperator that we've seen and let's bring in the first string from colors.So, let's type colors and sub element zero,and let's add another string at the end with a question mark.Now, if we console.log question, andwe run that, we'll see that we get the question,do you like the color red, with a question mark at the end.But we have three different colors, so we might want to do that again foreach of those colors.So, let's copy and paste that andlet's change colors[0] to colors[1].Now, if we clear and run that, we see do you like the color red, andwe see do you like the color green, and of course, we can do that againwith colors[2], which will be the third element in the colors array.And if we clear and run that again, we see that we get our third question,do you like blue.So, now we have three different questions.But there's a lot of repeated code in here.We've had to redefine question three times.Each time, we had to write out the whole string, we had to add the quotes,we had to add the concatenation operators, we had to use the question mark,we had to do the console.log.It would be so much more convenient, if we could get JavaScript to do that for us.And, it's a programming language.This is a computer.It's supposed to be good at doing repetitive things for us sothat we don't have to do them ourselves.And that brings us to one of our first convenient uses forblock statements, iteration.
Block Statements for Iteration

You can group statements together so that they can be repeated within a block, andthen you can use control flow statements to execute them.And control flow statements tell JavaScript when to execute a block ofstatements, how often, how many times, etc.And let me show you right here in pseudocode how that would work.Imagine that we have our array of colors, and we have our question.And, what we want is something in JavaScript that's going to say foreach color in the array colors, do these things.Assign a value to the question variable that says, do you like, put in the currentcolor, and then put a question mark in, and then put the output of that.So, how would we get JavaScript to do this for us?Because clearly, what we've got written here isn't real JavaScript code.Another way to use block statements is to execute a block conditionally based
Block Statements for Conditions

on the value of a Boolean.What we can tell JavaScript to do is execute a block only ifa condition is evaluated as true.And remember, we've discussed before how to evaluate an expression to see whetherit returns a value of true.Now, we can see how to make use of that.And let me show you some pseudocode to explain where we're going with this.Imagine for example, that we had an array of colors, red, green, and blue, andwe had a selection that let the user choose which of those colors they liked.And the user in this case might have chosen color zero, which we know is red.We can console .log.You chose colors sub selection.In this case, you chose red.But we want to give the user some feedback about that as well.For example if they chose red, we'd like to set say,just like Little Red Riding Hood.If they choose green, we'll want to say just like Peter Pan.If they're going to choose blue, we would say just like Little Boy Blue.And if they choose a number that wasn't in the array already,we could just say, that's nice.So, how would JavaScript let us do something like what we're describing here?In the next few lessons, I'm going to take you through some examples of Control Flow
Coming Up: Control Flow and Iteration

and Iteration because there are some key words that will tell JavaScript to doexactly what we've just tried to do in the pseudo code in the previous examples.Execute a block of statements.Those keywords that I'm going to go over are if,which does control flow based on a Boolean.For, which can iterate over the elements in an array.Switch, which can do control flow based on a value, and while,which could iterate, based on a Boolean value.

Pseudo Code for Iteration

In addition to using Boolean conditions to control the flow through your program,I'm going to tell you a little it about the For statement, and how that works.So, I'm going to show you some pseudo code forhow you might want to iterate through an array.An iteration, in this case, would be repeating a block of statements.JavaScript lets you group statements together to be repeated in blocks andthen use these control flow statements to execute them.So what is it that we're trying to get JavaScript to accomplish?Well we've seen this example before.We have an array of colors, red, green, and blue.And we have a question.And what we would like JavaScript to do is take each one of the colors,in colors, and change the question to, do you like the current color?And then, console.log that question out.So the output would be, "Do you like red?" the first time,"Do you like green?" the second time, and "Do you like blue?" the third time.And all of this without having to repeat writing the same code over and over again.A For loop lets you iterate, and there are four elements to a For statement.
"For" Loop Iteration

The first is the initial condition that defineswhat the state of the world is when the loop begins.Next is the final condition,that says, how does the loop know when to stop executing?The third is an iterator, which says, what changes forone loop to the next in order to know that you're advancing?And the fourth is a block of code that you want to execute.And I'm going to show you the code forhow we can accomplish what we were trying to do in our pseudo code.In this case, we'll start out againwith a variable that's colors, andwe'll set that to an array of red, green, and blue.And we'll also create a variable that's going to be the question that wewant output.Now how do we tell JavaScript which item that we want in the colors array.In order to do this, we're going to need need a variable that says what index pointin the array we want to be at.So let's create a variable called counter, as well.And we're going to use counter to represent the valuethat the array is currently using to decide which index value to display.Now we're going to use a new keyword, and that's the for keyword.And we're going to create a set of conditions, an initial condition, a finalcondition, and an iteration that says how to move among these different conditions.We're going to put them in parentheses.The first condition is going to be what state we want things to start at.So we want counter to be equal to zero at the very beginning.That means we're going to start our loop with counter set to zero.And how are we going to know when our loop is done?Well, we already know that we can determine the length of the colors arrayby using the length property.And we want our loop to execute until the counter is the same as the lengthof the array.So we might want our terminal condition to be counter has to be lessthan colors.length, which we know in this case is going to be three.So we've already told our For statement that we want the counter to start at zero,and we want it to keep on looping until counter is less than colors.length,which in this case is three.But what do we want to happen in between each loop in order to advance our counter?Well, why don't we use our increment operator?We can do counter++.What this is going to do is set the value of counter to counter plus one.We've seen this before.So we now have three different states inside of our for loop represented.We've got our initial state, where the counter is equal to zero.We've got our terminal state, where the counter is less than colors.length.And we've got what we want to happen in between each loop of the iterator,which is that the counter should increment by one.We've separated these by semicolons because each one of them isa separate statement.Now we need to determine what block of statements we want executedduring this For loop.So we're going to create a block.And inside of it, we're going to set the value of question toDo you like, andthen the color will be colors.And we have to pass it an index value.Where are we going to get that index value?Well we already know that each time we iterate through the loop,we're changing the value of counter from zero to one, to two,until the loop is greater than the length of colors.length.So, why don't we pass that value in here.We can set colors sub counter, and each time that we loop through the statement,it'll change the value of counter to be the current index value.And, of course,we also have to add a question mark at the end because it's English, and Englishquestions end in question marks just like JavaScript statements end in semicolons.Now, we can console.log(question).And let's run this and see what we get.Do you like red?Do you like green?Do you like blue?What's happened here, is that we've created our array of three elements, andwe've created question and counter variables to use inside of our For loop.Then we created a For loop and gave it three different states.An initial state, where counter is equal to zero.The terminal state, where counter has to be less than colors.length,which we know is three here.And an incrementer which happens between each loop, counter++.Then we created a block of statements where we have a question that's being setto, do you like the counter value of colors which iscolors with a counter index of zero and then one and then two.With a question mark at the end.And finally we console.logged question.So the first time counter was equal to zero.And when it got to this loop, it said do you like color sub counter,which was color sub zero, which is red.And then it console.logged that value.The second time, it said counter is equal to one.Do you like colors sub one, which was green, and it console.logged green.And finally, it sets counter to two, which is index three of colors.And we got, Do you like blue?For loops are one of the basic tools for flow control in a JavaScript program.And I just want to take you through the four elements of a Forstatement in a little bit more detail.So you're more familiar with how they work.
Initial Conditions

We'll start with the initial conditions.It's important to remember to declare any variables that you are going to be usingin a loop first.And also remember not to reuse the same iterator variable from one loop tothe next.If you look at Java script programs written by other programmers,you may see them using the same iterator over and over again.If you're careful, you can get away with it.But you must be very careful, because sometimes you can forgetthat an iterator has been set to a new value before starting again.And if you don't three set the initial conditions properly,you can get into trouble.
Terminal Conditions

The terminal conditions of a For loop tell the loop when it's time to stop looping.And this is structured just like a Boolean.As long as the value returned by the terminal condition is true,the loop will continue executing.Once that value returns as false, then the loop stops executing andcontinues on to whatever is past it in the code.
Iteration of "For" Loop

The iteration part of a Forloop tells what changes between each loop in order to move the process forward.And in the iterator, you can change anything that you like.Usually you upgrade a counter, sometimes by one, sometimes by more than one.It depends on what you're program is actually trying to accomplish.An interesting thing to note is the actually expressions inside a Forloop are all optional.You don't need an initial condition, a terminal condition, an iteration, oreven a block of code to execute.If you create a For loop that looks like this,which doesn't have an initial condition, a terminal condition, oran iterator, you're basically creating an infinite loop.JavaScript will not stop you from creating an infinite loop.It's going to continue iterating forever and ever andever, until you do something about it.
The "Break" Statement

And because of that, it's useful to know about the break statement.There's a break keyword that lets you break out of a loopif a certain condition is met.And the break statement will interrupt the loop before the terminal conditionis reached.And let me demonstrate quickly how that would work with what would otherwise bean infinite loop.Let's create a variable, we're going to call it counter.We're going to set it to zero.Now let's create a For loop.And this one, we're not going to give any conditions.There's no initial state, there's no terminal state, and there's no iterator.Basically, that means everything inside of this block statement is going tokeep on executing forever.So let's console.log.This could go on forever.And I hesitate to go over here andrun this right now because if I were to do that, my program would start running.And every time that it ran this loop it, would keep just keep executing it againand again and again, and the browser could end up crashing.But let's put in a break statement.JavaScript lets you insert one control flow statement right inside of another,and it will continue to control the flow based on where it starts.So let's put an If statement in here, and if counter++,which is going to increment the counter every single time we go through the loop,is greater than 10.Let's pass it another block of statements, and in this case we just wantone statement in this block, and we're just going to say break.And the break statement tells a For loop that's running to go ahead andstop running even if it hasn't reached it's terminal condition.Now the For loop we've created here doesn't have a terminal condition,so it'll keep running forever until that break statement is encountered.That break statement is not going to be encountered until counteris greater than ten.So if we run it now, we can trust that it's not going to run forever.It's just going to run until the counter is incremented to greater than 10.Notice that we put the ++ at the end, soit's going to evaluate the value of counter before incrementing each time.Ultimately, doing it this way gives us total of 12 lines.As an exercise, take yourself through the code, and see if you can figure out why.There may be times when you're going to want to let the conditions of a programdetermine when it should break out of a Forloop before the terminal condition is reached.So it's useful to know about break statements.It's unusual to see a for loop without an initial state, a terminal state, andan iterator, or even a block to execute.But it's good to know that it's possible.

Thank You

So thank you for joining me for this tour of JavaScript.We've gone pretty quickly through a number of the fundamentals, butI think I've given you a good grounding for understanding some of how JavaScriptworks and how you can interpret some of the scripts that you come across.So, what did you learn in this course?
What Did You Learn?

Well, this was an introduction to programming, andwe were using JavaScript, butit was intended as a broad introduction to programming concepts in general.We went through some of the different coding environments thatJavaScript can run in.Then we went talked about the syntax, variables andtypes that you're going to encounter using JavaScript.We talked about JavaScript operators, and we discussed JavaScript statements.Finally, we took a deep dive into functions andshowed a few of the different ways that JavaScript uses functions.Finally, I gave you a coding challenge.And I'm looking forward to seeing what you do with it, and how your code looks.You should consider this a starting point for your explorations in JavaScript.Now you have the basic tools and the basic vocabulary forunderstanding how programming in JavaScript works.Go out there and look at programs that you want to understand better, and
Best of Luck!

see if you can pick apart how they accomplish what they're trying to do.Best of luck in your coding adventures with JavaScript.I look forward to hearing what you do next.

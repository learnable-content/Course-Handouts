Number Variables

So now that we've gone over string variables,let's go over number variables in a little more detail.Like string variables number variables are primitives.And unlike some programming languages,in JavaScript all number variables are treated as floating point values.That the difference between an integer anda floating point value is that an integer is a round numberwhereas a floating point value is tracked beyond the decimal point to sub-values.If you compare a variable that's in the set to a whole number anda variable that's been set to a floating point number in JavaScript.JavaScript will consider them the same value because,to JavaScript, floating point values, integer values are treated the same.
Number Primitives

Now number variables are also primitives just like string variables.That means that they passed their value when they're copied,leaving the original unchanged.Let me demonstrate that for you.So let's create a variable called number1 andwe're going to set it to the value of 123.Then we're going to create a variable,called number2, and we're going to set it to number1.And what this is going to dois take the value of number1 and assign it to variable number2.So if we do a console.log(number1) anda console.log(number2).And then we run we would expect them to have the same value, andthey do have the same value.Now if we go in and change number2 to be 456, andthen let's just copy and paste that code.And if we clear and run again, we'll see that number1 has not been changed,but number2 has been changed to 456.This means that only the value of number1 was passed to number2 when we assigned it.And again, this may seem like an intuitive way for variables to work, butnot all variables in JavaScript will work this way.And we're going to be talking about a few examples later.Now, this may seem like an intuitive way for variables to work, but as we'vediscussed before, not all variables in JavaScript are going to behave that way.We're going to see a few examples later.Just like variables of type string variables of type
Number Methods

number also have a set of specific methods that can be used to process them.For example, you can use the parseint method to pull out the integer value, orwhole number value, from a floating point variable number.You can use parseFloat to pull out the floating point valueof a number, to assert.The toString method will convert a number to a string.What this does is take the value of the number, andoutput it as a string between quotes which can no longer be used as a number, butcan be used to present information inside of another string.Similarly the toFixed method creates a string out of the value of a number, butlimits it to a certain number of digits past the decimal point.And the two precision method does the same thing, limiting the total numberof digits for the string that's created to the number passed in to two precision.Let me walk you through a few of these methods and show you how they work sothat you get familiar with them.
Examples of Number Methods

We'll start by creating a variable called example andwe'll set it to a value of 5.5.Which is a floating point value.As I mentioned before,all numbers in JavaScript treated as floating point values.Even if they're integers and have no value after the decimal point.To pull out the whole number integer value of this variable,essentially dropping off everything after the decimal point we can use parseInt.So let's do a console.log, and we'll do a parseInt of example.And we're going to pass it the number 10,and the reason we do this is because we want it to parse the integer in base 10.If you don't pass the 10, you risk the possibility that it might be processed ina different base, which would give you a different result.So let's go over here and run that.And we'll see that that just gives us the 5.Essentially like chopping off everything after the decimal point.And these methods process the value of the variable butthey don't actually affect the variable itself.We can demonstrate this by doing a console.log exampleand clearing and running again, and we'll see that it's still set to 5.5.But we can do a parseFloat, console.log (parseFloat) forexample, and in this case we don't need to pass in a base.We clear and run again,and we can see that we get back the float value of our original variable.Now if we wanted to convert this to a string, we could do a console.logexample.toString with the parentheses.If we clear and run we see that what we get is a string representationof exactly the value of example.Sometimes when you're creating a string out of a variable you want to havea certain number of digits in the result, for presentation purposes.For that reason, JavaScript includes the two fixed and two position methods, whichalso convert to strings but establish exactly how many digits will be shown.So for example, we can do a console.logexample.toFixed and set the value to 2.And if we clear and run again,we see that what we get is a string with two digits after the decimal point.Very convenient for doing currency for example.Similarly, we can do a console.log(example.toPrecision) andpass it the value 3.If we clear and run again we'll see that we get the same value.But because we set it to three fortwo precision, we're getting three digits being presented as part of the string.All of these number methods assume that you're starting with a variable thatis actually a number to begin with.
Numbers That Aren't Numbers

But sometimes you can get strange results.If you try to apply them to variables that aren't numbers orif you use mathematical operations on variables that are not numbers.An impossible value for a number will result in a value JavaScript calls NAN,which means not a number.Let me show you how that can happen when you're programming.So let's create a variable, and we're going to call it notNumber.And we're going to set it to 5, which is a number,multiplied by "Word", which is not a number.But if we were to console.log notNumber andthen over here click run and then what we would get is this strange NAN value.Now NAN means this is not a number so the result actually can't be parsed andprocessed by JavaScript.If you've ever been on a webpage where you were looking forresults from a pricing table, for example, and you saw NAN show up anywhere.That means that the programmers didn't check to make sure that their results wereactually generating real numbers when they tried to present them.Now, one interesting thing about NaN.Let's do a console.log(typeof(notNumber));.If we clear and run that we'll see that the type of notNumber is a number.That's one of those little idiosyncrasies about JavaScript.It's important to know if you ever start testing fornumbers to make sure that they're actually valid.Not a number will show as a valid number, so be careful.

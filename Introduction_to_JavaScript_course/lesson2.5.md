Introduction to Strings

So now we've been introduced to what variables are.And we've discussed some of the different data types that variables can contain.Letâ€™s do a deep dive into strings,one of the data types that your likely going to be working with most frequently.So what are string variables?
String Variables Defined

Basically a string is one or more text elements between quotes.So for example, if we were to create a variable called letter,and assign that the value of a capital A between quotes, letter would be a string.If we created a variable called sentence, andassign it the value, a sentence is a string between quotes.The variable sentence is also a string variable.String variables are treated typically as primitive variables.And a little later in this course we are going to be getting into the differencebetween primitive, and reference type variables.Primitive variables pass their value when they're copied.
String Primitives

Leaving the original value unchanged.And this is important to understand because it's going tochange the way that you interact with string variables.Let me give you some examples, so that you understand how this works.We're going to start by creating a variable called sentence, andgiving it a value of a sentence is a string.Now we're going to create a second variable called sentence2.And we're going to set sentence2 to the same value of sentence1.That means that we're going to assign the value of sentence2, sentence.This is something that's possible to do in JavaScript.Basically we're copying the value of sentence into sentence2.Now if we did a console.log of sentence.And a console.log of sentence2.Go over here into the console and click run.We'll see that both of these variables have been set to the same value,the string "a sentence is a string.".Now let's change the value of sentence2.And set it to "This is differente sentence".And we're going to copy and paste the codethat does the console logging up here.Let's clear our console output and run it again.As we can see the first two times that console.log runs on sentence andsentence2.They're both set to the same value.The second time, sentence is set to "a sentence is a string.", butset sentence2 is set to "This is a different sentence".What you can see here is that sentence and sentence2 are different variables.And the fact that you set sentence2 to the value of sentence,doesn't mean that sentence2 has any controlover what happens to sentence when you make a change to sentence2.Now that might seem like an intuitive result, butthat's not always the case with variables in JavaScript, so pay attention.Because later we're going to be discussing some cases where changing the value ofone variable, affects the value of another.Once you start using string variables,
Some String Methods and Properties

the first thing you're going to want to do is start manipulating those strings.And there are a number of methods and properties to know about forvariables that are strings.So let's discuss some of the methods and properties that string variables have.Methods are functions, and they manipulate the data inside of a variable.Sometimes making changes to that variable, and sometimes not.Properties tell you information about the contents of that variable,without changing the contents.One of the properties of strings is the length.And this is how many characters there are between the quotes.One of the methods on strings is toUpperCase(),which changes all the letters in a string to upper-case versions of themselves.You'll notice that methods are represented with parentheses at the end.If you don't include the parentheses, the method won't work.Another method on strings is toLowerCase(),which changes all of the letters to their lower-case versions.You can also use the character at method.Passing in a position to find out what letter is at what position in the string.And the index of which determines the location of a substring, orshort segment of characters within a string.Lets go through these just so that you understand how they work and soyou can work with them yourself.
Examples of String Methods and Properties

To start with, let's create a variable.We'll call it sentence, and we'll give the value "A sentence is a string."Now let's console.log the length property of this sentence.So we can doconsole.log(sentence.length);.If we go over here to the console andclick run, we'll see that this sentence actually has 23 characters in it.Note that it's also including the spaces as part of the count.And the period at the end.Now lets try the two upper case method.We'll do a console.log(sentence.toUpperCase());.And be sure to include the parentheses so the method gets executed.If you clear over here, and run again.We'll see that the output of this is a sentence is a stringall in uppercase letters.Now it's worth noticing that if we go back and we console.log(sentence) again,even after executing the two uppercase method.We run this.We'll see that that to uppercase method did not actuallychange the value of sentence.What it did was it took the value, made a copy of it, andapplied the to uppercase method to that copy.The original was left unchanged.We can try the corresponding toLowerCase method, butI bet you know what this is going to do.console.log(sentence.toLowerCase()); withthe parenthesis, and if we go over here and Clear and Run again.We'll see that this took the original sentence, andconverted all of the letters to lowercase.And, once again, if we were to add a plain console.log of sentence right after that.We would see that toLowerCase also did not change the value of the original variable.It just made a copy, and output the value.With all of the letters changed to lower case.Now let's try the char at method.Which shows you what character is at what position in the string.So let's console.log(sentence.charAt andthen parenthesis with a semicolon.And inside of those parenthesis you're going to want to pass a value.And we're going to get into more about passing values to methods andfunctions later.But for now just know that what this is going to do is show us the characterat a certain position inside the string.And string characters are counted starting with position zero as the first position.So let's do charAt(0).Let's clear and run again.And as you would expect,the character at position 0 in a sentence is a string, is just the letter A.The corresponding method, to tell you what position in a stringa certain substring is, is the index of method.So let's do a console.log(sentence.indexof.And let's find the string is inside of there.And you'll note that we put that inside of quotes, because it's a substring.But it's still the string itself.So let's clear and run again.And what we find is that if we counted the number of spaces and letters beforethe first occurrence of the string, is, inside of a sentence is a sting.We would find out that the position of the letter I in is index point 11.And ass I mentioned before,none of these methods change the value of the original variable.They just take a copy of the contents, perform an operation on it, andreport the result.
Some String Search Methods

I showed you a couple of methods that have to do with findingthe contents of a string, and what characters are where.But there other methods for searching and replacing the contents of a string.For example, there's the replace method.Which takes an original substring, andreplaces it with a new substring inside the contents of the variable.There's also the substring method.Which gives you the set of characters that exist between a beginning point, andan end point within a string.Similar to the substring is a substr method.And the naming of these things can be confusing.But the substr method takes the starting point, andthe number of characters you want to count out from that starting point.To give you a sub string where as the substring methodtakes a starting point and an ending point.I'm going to walk you through a couple of examples, just so you're clear on this,because it's easy to get confused between them.But there are times when you want to use one, andtimes when you want to use another.
Examples of String Search Methods

So let's try out the replace method.What we're going to do is console.log(sentence.replace).And we're going to pass into replace the word sentence as the original string.And we're going to pass in the word, word as the replacement string.Now if we go over here and run this,what we're going to get is, a word is a string, instead of a sentence is a string.The method went in and replaced the word sentence with the word word.And again, if we console.log the original sentence,We can see that this didn't actually change the variable.All that it did was make a copy of the contents of the variable,make the modification in that copy, and return that result.Now let's try the substring method.So let's console.log(sentence.substring),and let's go from character 2 to character 10.We go over here to Clear and Run again.We'll see that what we've pulled out is the just word sentence.Which is from position 0 1 2 to position 10 inside of our original variable.A substring can also work without defining the final value.Let me give you an example of that.Console.log(sentence.substring(2)).What this is going to do when we clear andrun again, is it's going to return everything inside of that variable.Starting with value two, and going all the way to the end of the string.Now for comparison, let's try to pull up the exact same values,using the substr method instead of the sub string method.So let's do console.log(sentence.substr(2)) Andnow we want to start with character number two.But we only want to go eight characters in because the wordis only eight characters long.So from two, count out eight characters, and then return the value.So if we run this.We'll see that (sentence.substr(2,8)) returnsthe same value as (sentence.substring(2,10)).But similar to the substring method, the substr method will continueall the way to the end of the string if you don't define the second value.So if we do a console.log(sentence.substr(2)).And clear and run again.We'll see that the entire value, starting with character number two,is returned the same way that substring would do this.And again just as with the other string variable methods that we discussed.These methods do not make any changes to the original variable.All they do is make a copy of the contents, andthen perform manipulations in that copy, leaving the original untouched.

The History of JavaScript

Now before we get started,I'd like to tell you a little bit about this history of JavaScript.And this is going to be important, because JavaScript changes very quickly.As you look through examples of Java Script code from different places onthe internet and you read tutorials,you're going to find that people's coding styles and eventhe examples sometimes won't work in every version of every browser that you have.JavaScript was actually invented in 1995 for Netscape.They had a programmer named Brendan Eich who was charged withcreating a language called LiveScript.LiveScript was supposed to be a programming language that wouldexist in the browser to help developers manipulate the content of web pages.Just before LiveScript was actually released,the marketing people at Netscape decided to rename it JavaScriptto take advantage of the popularity of the Java programming language.Unfortunately, that decision has made it very confusing formany people what the differences are between Java and JavaScript.One of my favorite sayings is that Java is to JavaScript as cat is to catalog.There really is no relationship between the two languages.But JavaScript was developed in order to be easy to use.It was supposed to be a coding language that people could use directly in webpages to manipulate the elements there without really understanding the broadfundamentals of programming.JavaScript is compiled directly in the browser.What this means is when you write a piece of JavaScript code,the browser interprets that code in a way that it can directly execute.This means that once you have a browser installed on your system,you have a JavaScript interpreter and compiler right there at your fingertips.This made programming accessible to everybody.JavaScript was also designed to be cross-platform.Just like the browser the idea is that no matter what computer you're working withyou should be able to create a JavaScript program and have it run consistently.Now one of the early issues that hit the JavaScript world was standardization.JavaScript was developed by Netscape, and Netscape had its own browser.Microsoft also had it's own browser.And Microsoft wanted to customize the programming environmentto take advantages of special features that they had in their own browser.They developed variations called VBScript and JScript, which weren't completelycompatible with the general JavaScript that Netscape was developing.As a result, developers for years had to choose between working in JavaScript orin JScript or VBScript or creating subsets of those thatwere compiled in different ways to make them functional in both environments.Ultimately European Computer Manufacturers Association stepped in anddecided to establish a standard for JavaScript.
The Evolution of JavaScript.

The evolution of JavaScript led to ECMAScript-262 Edition 1.The ECMAScript-262 standard is actually broad enoughthat it also covers languages such as ActionScript, which powers Adobe's Flash.Over the years, JavaScript has continued to evolve.As recently as a few years ago,the JavaScript family was split between ECMAScript 3.1 and JavaScript 4.Ultimately JavaScript 4 was abandoned in favor of ECMAScript 3.1, andcurrently browsers support ECMAScript 5.The problem is that when you browse through tutorials that are onthe Internet, you may find code that's intended to supportdifferent versions of JavaScript, and that could be a little bit confusing.But if you keep in mind that this is how the language evolved,you can watch out for some of these landmines, andjust be aware that the more recent the tutorial, the more likely it is to supportthe environment that you're trying to develop for.But you don't need to worry about that for now.This class is going to focus on the fundamentals.
Our Focus in this Course

We're going to take you right back to what a variable is,how statements work, how functions work and give you the basis that you needin order to understand how to use and interpret JavaScript code.In this course, you won't be copying and pasting examples.You're going to be writing code from scratch.So let's get started.

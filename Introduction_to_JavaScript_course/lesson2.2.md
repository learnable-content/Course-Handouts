Potential Issues

While we're on the topic of syntax,I'd like to talk to you about some of the issues that you might run across whileyou're trying to work with JavaScript for the first time.JavaScript is case sensitive.It also has comments and reserved words that you should be aware of.Knowing about these in advance will help you avoid some of the common problems thatpeople run into when they're experimenting with a new language.
Case Sensitivity

Case sensitivity means that the names of the variables that you choose have tobe consistent in terms of upper case and lower case letters.JavaScript pays attention to the exact spelling of variable names,including the case.So, a variable whose name is all in lower case is not the same variable asa variable whose name has an upper case letter.Let me show you how you might encounter this situation.Imagine that we've created a variable called example.And given it the value coffee.And we've created another variable called Example with a capital E.And given it the value tea.Now, if we console.log each of these variables.And go over here and click run.We can see that these two variables contain different values,even though they're basically the same word.Now, this kind of variable naming is not very good practice when you're writingJavaScript.You want your variable names to represent what the content is actually going to be.So, programmers working with your code will understand what they mean, butthis is a demonstration that capital letters andlowercase letters are not interchangeable in variable names.Being considerate about how people read and
Comments

understand your code is very important.You're writing code so that it can be read and interpreted by a computer.But eventually, you're may need to go and edit your code yourself.Or, you may want to share it with somebody, andyou want them to be able to understand what you're writing about.To help facilitate this, JavaScript lets you write commentsin your code that aren't interpreted by the computer,but that can be read by somebody visually reading your code.A line in JavaScript that starts with two slashes is completely ignored bythe JavaScript compiler, and this is a good way to make notes in your code.For example, going back to our two variables that were very poorly named,we could add a comment before each one sayingthis will be coffee and this will be tea.And these are terrible comments, and terrible variable names, but forthe sake of the example this demonstrates.If we clear our console and then run again,you'll see that the lines we've added, which are very obviously not JavaScript,but just plain English, are ignored by the compiler and our code runs perfectly.Java script will also let you create multi-line comments by typing a /*,and then as much text as you want on as many lines as you want.And then ending them with a */.Everything between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler,just like single lines that begin with //.Again, if we clear and run the console, we get the same result without any errors.It's up to you how you choose to use comments in your code, butit's important to be consistent about where you put your comments, andhow you expect them to be interpreted.There are a number of other rules about how you name your variables in JavaScript,
Variable Naming Rules

and these can trip you up when you're starting out,because you might choose to name your variable something that is not actuallylegally permitted by the JavaScript compiler.So, here are a few rules to keep in mind when you're naming your variables.First of all, variables may only contain letters, numbers,the dollar sign symbol, or the underscore.Any other character cannot be used in the name of a variable.Variables must also not begin with a number.And they must not use words that have been reserved as JavaScript keywords.Let me show you some examples.Let's try to create a variable and give it a number as the first character.You can see at the bottom that JS Bin has warned us that we're creating a problem.There are two errors and one warning, andthat's because JavaScript doesn't understand that this isactually a variable name because it begins with a number.Let me show you a different example using a JavaScript keyword.Let's delete what we had there, and start fresh.We'll type var this = thing.Now, again JS Bin is giving us an error.And that's because the word, this, is actually a reserved JavaScript keyword.When JS Bin tries to interpret the code here,it doesn't understand that I'm trying to create a variable named this.That's not possible to do in JavaScript.Now, you haven't been exposed to enough JavaScript yetthat you know what the reserved keywords are.So, let me start you off with a list.
Reserved JavaScript Keywords

You could read through this and just keep in mind if you run into some ofthese words and you start trying to use them as variable names,JavaScript is going to throw an error.There are a few places online where you can look for more complete lists.And this list may change as new versions of JavaScript are released.This is the page where I got this list.And the Ecma International website is a good place to look forinformation about what is and is not possible in JavaScript.

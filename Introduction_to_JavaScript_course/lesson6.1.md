Introduction (and a Challenge)

Congratulations.You've made it through this course.And I've introduced you to a wide range of JavaScript functionality.By now you should be familiar with many of the basics of JavaScript.And in order to get you started experimenting with JavaScript,I'm going to issue you a challenge.
Word Puzzle

I'm going to ask you to try to create a word puzzleusing just the JavaScript functionality that I've shown you so far.What I would like you to do Is create a programthat can assemble a story from a template that has missing words.What it should do is insert the missing words into the template.And the words should come from a collection of nouns, adjectives, andverbs.And you can store these any way that you like andyou can access them any way that you like.To show you an example of what I am expecting,the template could be something such as I like to [verb].My favorite [noun] is [adjective] [noun].That's what makes me [adjective].So for example, we might have a set of words that includes verbs, such as ski,nouns, such as hat and tractor, and adjectives, such as gooey and purple.And the result that we output should be I like to ski.My favorite hat is gooey tractor.That's what makes me purple.So using the functionality of JavaScript that we've been exposed to sofar, create a program that does exactly this.Takes a template and a set of words, and gives us an output that looks like this.And this would be a good time to stop the video and go experiment.
Random Output (Bonus Challenge)

Now if you haven't completed the first challenge, I want you to go back andfinish it, because the next one is going to build on it.Our bonus challenge is to include random output.And in order to randomize the output I want you to use this rand functionthat I'm going to create for you in order to randomize your output.And what this rand function will do is return a random whole numberfrom one to whatever maximum whole number you pass it.And it's going to look like this.So you can see we're creating a variable called rand andwe're assigning it an anonymous in line function that takes a maximum value.It's returning a mathematical calculation that will take that maximum value andreturn a random number anywhere from one to that maximum value.So if you see the examples below, if we console.log random of five,the first time it might return two, the second time it might return one.Each time that you run it, it will return a different number from one to five.What I want you to do is use this functionto randomize the order in which your script inserts the words into your output.So that the output is unique each time that you run it.Now the example of this, we might use multiple verbs such as ski, eat,and drive.Multiple nouns such as hat, tractor, box, and robot.And multiple adjectives such as gooey, purple, strong, and bored.And the first time we run it, the output might be I like to drive.My favorite tractor is purple box.That's what makes me purple.The second time we run it the output might be I like to eat.My favorite robot is strong tractor.That's what makes me bored.And the third time we might get I like to eat.My favorite hat is bored hat.That's what makes me strong.The point is each time we run it we should get a different randomized set of wordsinserted into the template.So go modify the code that you created to incorporate this randomization.
Don't Repeat Words (2nd Bonus Challenge)

Now again, if you haven't completed the first two examples,you're going to want to do that before going forward in the video,because this next example builds on those first two.What I want you to do is modify your script sothat words are not being repeated.The way that we've done it so far, each time that we run the script,the same word could be inserted multiple times in the same sentence.What I'd like you to do, is figure out a way to prevent the same wordfrom being used twice in the same output.And, while you're at it,you should think about what might happen if you run out of words.And can you prevent that from breaking your program?Go back to your example code, and see if you can figure this challenge out, andthen we're going to take this to the next level with interactive user input.
Real User Input (3rd Bonus Challenge)

If you haven't done the previous challenges,I really encourage you to stop the video and do those before moving onto this one.Because now we're going to incorporate real user input.I'm going to show you in the browser two browser methods called prompt and alert.And they may look different in different browsers, butthey should function the same way.Using the prompt method in browsers,you can create a variable in your script called input.And when the script gets to that variable it's going toput up an alert on the screen asking the user to fill in a value.And at that point your script is going to wait for the user to fill in a value, andthen click the OK button, before going on.At that point,whatever the user's put into the prompt will be the value of the variable input.The next method is the alert method, and what the alert method does is pop upan alert on the screen that shows you the value that you pass to the alert method.So in this case if we set the input variable to a prompt of what is your nameand we're running Chrome, we might get a prompt that looks like this in the script.It would include the string, what is your name, andit would leave space for the user to input a value.In this case my name is David so I put David, and I would click okay.At that point in my script the value of the variable inputwould be the string David.Then I could do a alert of hello with the value of the input variable andthe alert would pop up on my screen looking something like this, Hello David.And different browsers will display these prompts in different ways.But all browsers should support this kind of prompt and alert method.
Final Bonus Challenge

So using what we've just learned about prompts and alerts,the next challenge is to use a series of prompts to collect as many nouns,adjectives, and verbs as you need to fill out your particular template.And then use an alert to display your final story output after you've collectedthe last word from your user.

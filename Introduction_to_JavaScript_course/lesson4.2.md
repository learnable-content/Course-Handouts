"If" Statements

The first control-flow statement in JavaScript that we're going to go overis the If Statement.If Statements use Boolean conditions.By testing the Boolean state of an expression,an if statement can decide whether or not to execute a particular block of code.And this is one of the most basic examples of why you want to useblock statements in your JavaScript.Let me show you a very simple example of how an if statement works.Let's create a variable.And we're going to set call it color, we're going to set it to red.And we can console.log,(You.chose " + color).And if we run that, we get you chose red.Now, what if we wanted to give people certain feedback based on which colorthey chose?For example, if color is equal to blue,we might want to execute a block of statements in that particular condition.So we could create a block and do console.log.Blue is my favorite favorite color.And if we clear and run that, we'll see that again, we only get you chose red.The if statement here used the boolean value of this expression,to determine whether or not to execute the statements inside of this block.In this case there's only one statement in this block, butthat statement was clearly was not executed.Because the color that it was chosen at the beginningwas not the same as the color in here.Color equals blue was false.So, this statement was not executed.If I go in here and change red to blue, and I clear and run again.You'll see in this case, you choose blue is still being executed.And the if statement evaluates color == "blue" as true.Therefore it executes the statements inside of this block.This one statement, that console.log("Blue is my favorite color").And just to drive the point home, if we changed the color now to green.And we cleared and ran again, all we would get is "You chose green".You would not get anything from the If statement,because green does not equal blue.Just being able to use an If statement to execute ornot execute a block of code is very powerful.But if statements actually have a companion called else.
"If" and "Else" Keywords

Else statements operate in the context of the if,and they let you tell the program what to do if the previous condition is false.Let me show you how that would work.Coming back to our previous example.We have the color = "green" and console.log("You chose " + color),which brought out "You chose green".Then we have an if statement that decides,if (color == "blue") console.log("Blue is my favorite color") Color.But what do we want to do if somebody chooses a color other than blue?Well, we can use the else statement, andgive else a different block of code to execute.So for example, we might want to console.log, you have bad taste.And if we clear and run that.We'll see that if we have green as the color that's chosen,the output includes you chose green.And then you get the output, you have bad taste.On the other hand, if we change the color to blue, and we clear andrun again, we'll see that you chose blue as output.As well as blue is my favorite color.Our if conditional in this case figured out that color equals blue was true.And executed this block that says, blue is my favorite color.Then it ignored everything else because it had completed.On the other hand, if we had a color such as red up here.And we cleared and ran that, our if statement, when it is encountered,would see color equals blue is false.So it would ignore the first statement in here, go directly to the else statement.And the else statement says to execute a blockthat includes console.log "You have bad taste".So "You chose red" "You have bad taste" is what we get in the output.If and Else together give you a lot of power, but we're not done yet.
Multiple "Else" Conditions

Because JavaScript actually supports multiple Else conditionsto a single If statement.What you can do with multiple Else statements, is branch to different blocks.Let me show you an example of how that would work.We've got our same example here, with the color equal to red with console.log youchose with the name of the color.And our if statements, that determines if the color is blue,execute this first statement.Let's modify this else and add an if to it.And let's give it a condition.So else if (color == "red") {,and we'll give it a block to execute.And inside of this block, we're going to putconsole.log("That's not as bad as green").And we'll give a final else that will catch any conditions that aren't met inthe previous statements.So, let's look through the logic of this.If color is equal to blue, it's going to execute this first statement, andit'll be completely done.On the other hand, if color is not equal to blue,it's going to check the if conditional after the first else.And it's going to say, is the color red?And if the color is equal to red,it's going to execute the second block statement.Which in this case, is console.log("That's not as bad as green").However, if the color is not blue, and the color is not red, then it'll fallthrough to the final Else statement that doesn't have an if associated with it.And that's going to catch all of the other conditions.And in that case, it'll execute this final block,which does a console.log of ("You have bad taste").So, let's clear and run this, andwe see that, if color is equal to red, we get "You chose red".That's not equal to blue.So, the first if statement is false.It falls through to the if statement following the first else,to see if color is equal to red.Color is equal to red.And it executes console.log,that's not as bad as green, which is the output that we get.If we change color to green, and we clear andrerun, we'll see, you chose green, you have bad taste.If we change the color to blue, and we clear and rerun, we see, you chose blue.Blue is my favorite color.And because this else statement doesn't care what value is in here,we could change the color to purple.And if we clear and run again, we'll see you choose purple.You have bad taste.Any color other than blue or red is going to fall through, andbe caught by the final else statement in our set of conditionals.Using just the power of if and else,you can create complex programs that branch to multiple conditions, and solvedifferent problems based on the state of the different variables in your program.But there are some other more advanced control flow statements in Java Script toknow about as well.

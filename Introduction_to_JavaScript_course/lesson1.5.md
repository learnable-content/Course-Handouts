Online Testing and Development Tools

I'd like to show you one last way that you can experiment with JavaScript andthat's through online testing and development tools.You can do JavaScript in the cloud using these tools andthese are services created by companies that allow you to create accounts,where you can edit and manipulate JavaScript and see the results andeven share those results with other people.There are a number of these online sandboxes available for testing andsharing your code.For example, JSFiddle.net, CodePen.io and jsbin.com.For the sake of this tutorial,I'm going to walk you through how to setup jsbin.com, but the others are similar.
Setting Up JSBin.com

So to begin with, you'd want to go to jsbin.com,then I'm going to show you how that would work.In your browser, you just type jsbin.com.Without logging in, you get this opening screen,which shows some information about JSBin at the top andat the bottom gives you some windows where you can actually write code.I'm going to get rid of this feature window up at the top.There are a number of tabs presented on jsbin.com and forthe sake of this tutorial,the best thing to do is to turn on the JavaScript tab, turn on the Console tab.Turn off the HTML tab and then turn off the Output tab.In this context, you're right in the middle of a JavaScript shell andyou can do all of the things that you could do in the other JavaScript shellsthat we've discussed.For example, over here in the Console, you can type 2+2 and you'll get a result of 4.Or you could do console.log('hello,jsbin') and you get the result "hello, jsbin".Over here on the JavaScript side, I'm going to write something.Console.log("hello, JavaScript").One thing I'd like you to notice about JSBin is that it's setup to do linting or
Linting

dynamic testing of your code while you're writing it.So for example, down here at the bottom, I've got this line written andan error message has come up.According to the error message, line one is missing its semicolon and that's true.I didn't put a semicolon at the end of my line.So if I add the semicolon, that error message will go away.While you're learning how to write JavaScript, figuring out how the syntaxworks, this kind of linting or testing of your code is very convenient to have.Now that I've written a program, I can go over here to the Console and
Run Your Program

click Run and my program will run and the result gets put here into the Console.You can do this with any JavaScript that you're working on in this course.And in fact, I'm going to be using JSBin formany of the examples that I'm going to be demonstrating for you.Now that you know a little bit about how JSBin works.Another thing I'd like to show you is how you can share a JSBin program.
Share a JSBin Program

Everything you write in JSBin can be shared using a simple code,you don't even need an account to do this.So let's go back to our JSBin window.And over here,I'd like to draw your attention to the URL at the top of the screen.You'll see that there's a term that's been added to the edit and JS console.You'll see that there's a word that's been added to your URL.This is a unique strength that JSBin generates every time that you start toedit some code inside of the JavaScript window.If you were to take this, copy it,create a new window And paste that in.It would bring you right back to right where you editing your code.This is something you can save and share with other people.This means that you can interact with JavaScript and save your place andgo back and share it.And if you create an account,there are many additional features that JSBin offers.So while you're learning JavaScript,JSBin is one more convenient environment you might want to consider forworking through the tutorials and experimenting with your code.

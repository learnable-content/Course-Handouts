Functions in JavaScript

Welcome back.This is lesson five of Introduction to Programming in JavaScript.And now, I'm going to take you into the realm of functions in JavaScript.So what is a function and why would you want to use one?
Calling a Block of Code

Well, first of all we've shown you a few different ways of calling blocks of code.For example, we've shown you iterators.And an iterator can loop over a block of code.And repeat the same block of statements over andover again, passing in a variable that says what the count of that loop is.Float control can branch to different blocks of code.In this case, can determine whether or not we want to executea particular block of code based on a different set of flow control criteria.But, what if you just want to call a certain block of codethat might exist somewhere else in your program?Well, what if you could give a block of code a name?By giving a block of code a name, you'd be able to call it whenever you wanted to.It'd be kind of like creating a new keyword in JavaScript.That's exclusively for use with your own code.Well that's kind of what a function is.A function lets you name a block of statements andcall it whenever you want to.Let me show you a very quick example.I'm going to create a function for you right now.Let's call it function sayHi.We're going to follow it with parenthesis and then give a block of code to execute.And in this case the block of code is just going to do a console.log of Hi.So now, in order to call this function,all we have to do is sayHi followed by the parentheses.And you'll remember previously we've shown you that methods followed by parenthesesexecutes some code,in this case the code is the code that lives within this code block.So if we run, we get "Hi".And just that easily we've declared and used our first function.
Declaring and Using Functions

Declaring and using functions in JavaScript is pretty straight forward.Functions can be defined either before orafter the code that uses them as long as their available in the same scope.And functions can make use of any variables that existed when the functionwas called and they can make changes to those variables as well, so be careful.Let me show you an example.We're going to create a variable, just called, color.We're not going to assign it any value yet.And we'll declare a function called, changeColor.And we'll give it a block of statements to execute.Now in this case,this block of statements It's just going to be a nice switch statement.We've seen these before, and we're going to do a switch on the variable color.And we'll create a block in there, and in the case,Of color being red,we want to set color to blue and then break.And in the case of color being greenwe want to set the color to red.And we shouldn't forget our break, andour default case, we just want to set color to green.So now we have a function changeColor that will affect the variable color that livesoutside of it.Now we can call this function before we've even defined it in JavaScript.So first of all let's console.log color.Just to verify that currently it has an undefined value.Now if we call our changeColor function,and lets copy and paste this, and console dot log color again.We clear andrun, we see that calling changeColor changes the value of color to green.If we copy and paste those two lines again, sothat again we're running changeColor, we clear and run.We see that now our function changeColor has changed the color to red andthat's because here in our switch statement we had a case of green, andif the color variable is set to green it will change the color variable to red.If we paste those two lines again, and clear and run we see that the colorhas now been changed to blue because if the case is red the color changes to blue.And we can continue this way.And it doesn't matter that the definition of the function existsafter the place where we're calling the function in the code.When JavaScript runs, the very first thing it does is goes through the entireset of code available to it, finds all of those functions andmakes them available to the code that you're going to be running.The other thing to keep in mind Is that the color variable,which lives outside of the function, was being modified inside the function, andit was changed by that function.So functions can be declared anywhere in your code.Before or after they're used.And they do have access to variables that exist outside of their own context.When you want to call a function,
Result of Calling a Function

you need to call the name of the function followed by parentheses.If you don't use the parentheses what JavaScript does isthat it returns the code that made up that function.With the parentheses that function is actually executed.When you execute a function, you also have the option of returning a value.But if you don't specify a return value fora function the return value of that function will be undefined.Let me show you what that means.Going back to our example if we console.logchangeColor and we clear andwe run, and we don't put the parentheses after changeColor,what we actually get back is the function change color.The full code of that function.On the other hand, if we put in the parentheses andwe clear and run again, we see that what we get is the value undefined.And that's because changeColor, the function,has been created without a return value, which we're going to get to in a minute.However, just because there's no return value,that doesn't mean that the changeColor function hasn't been run.The fact that we got undefined demonstrates that it has.And in fact if we console.log(color)right now and clear and run again, we'll see that it did run.And color was changed from being an undefined variable to being green.So even though a function may not actually return a result, as long as it's executedit will perform the statements inside of the block of code that its executing.
Specifying a Return Value

But you can specify a return value for a function.As a matter of fact, you can only specify one return value for any given function.Although you can use conditional logic inside of a functionto have multiple places where different return values might come back.Each execution of a function can only return one value.And as we've demonstrated, you must actively return a value from a function orthat function will return undefined.Let me show you how we can modify the function we were working onto return a value.All we have to do is add a line down here at the bottom of the functionthat says return.And then tell it what we want the function to return.And in this case when we have it return, the current value of color,which is going to be that variable right there.Now, if clear and run again, we see that console.log,the function changeColor, returns the value green, andconsole.log(color); also retails the value green.Unless we tell JavaScript to display ordo something with the return value of a function it won't show up in our results.So for example if we do another changeColor here andwe clear and run that second changeColor executed.And because the value of color at the time that it executed was green.It actually changed color to red.But even though we had a return value of color,we weren't displaying that return value anywhere.We weren't doing anything with it.So it doesn't show up.We can prove that we have actually changed color to redby doing the console.log here of color.And if we clear and run that, we'll see that red does show up, butthat return value for changeColor doesn't actually show up anywhere.The only reason it showed up in the first line is because we're doing a console.log,which shows the return value of that function.It's a good practice to have a return value for every function sothat you have a way of defining that the function has concluded andtesting the results of that function.The return statement in a function,
Return Terminates Execution

once it gets there, will stop execution of the function.Anything that you put in a function beyond that return statementwill not be executed.There can only be one value returned for every execution of a function, andthe return statement can be used to stop the execution of a function much the sameway that a break statement can be used to break out of the execution of a loop.And let me demonstrate this.We're going to modify our switch statement here.So that instead of the break we're going to just have if the case is red,return blue.If the case is green, return red.And then the default state let's return green.And down here at the bottom, we don't need another returnstatement because all of our returns have been handled above butlets try a console.log of a sentence, andthat sentence is going to be, this will never be shown.And that's because once this switch statement is executed,a return would have been called, and this console.log will never actually be shown.We can demonstrate this.Let's console.log color tostart with, and if we clear and run this, of course, color is undefined.But now, let's set color equal to the return value of calling changeColor.So now we're executing changeColor andwe're setting color to the return value of changeColor.If we consoled out log color again, we see that color has been changed to green,and you'll notice that this will never be shown was not shown.We can do that again.We can set color again to the return value of changeColor,and if we clear and run again, we can see that color has been set to "red", andthe console.log("This will never be shown") has never been shown.When you're writing functions, you can forget sometimes that the code thatcomes after a return statement won't be executed.But keep that in mind sothat you don't end up writing code that's never going to get called.

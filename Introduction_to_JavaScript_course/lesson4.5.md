"For...In" Statements

I've shown you some ways that you can iterate over the elements in an array, butyou can also iterate over the elements inside of an object,using the For...In Statement.If you want to iterate over all of the properties of an object using the methods
Iterating Over Object Properties

we've shown so far, probably the first thing you would needis an array of keys showing each property in the object.And then you would use a for loop to iterate through it.Imagine we had a variable, and we'll call it toy,and we're going to make it into an object.And we're going to give it the properties color,size, and shape, andlet's set those to red, put a comma,size large and shape round.Now in order to iterate over all of the elements in this object,the first thing that we might need is an array of all of the keys.So, let's create a new variable called toyProperties, andwe're going to set that to the keys method of object, for toy.So we're going to set that to Object.keys(toy).And what this is going to give us after I correct my typois an array that lists just color, size, and shape.And I can console.log that quickly so that you can see what we have, toyProperites.And if we run that, we'll see that I have left out an equal sign, solet's set this toy equal to this, and we'll clear and run again, andyes we get an array of color, size and shape.And these are the three keys.Now that we have an array, we know that we can iterate through that using a for loop.So let's also set up a variable called counter,which we do not have to define at this point.What we're going to want to do is log out each of these different styles, solet's create a variable called style as well, sowe have something to populate with a value.Now we can create a for loop, andwe can set our initial state to counter is equal to zero.And let's set our terminal condition to make sure that the counter has to stayless than toyProperties.length,so that we don't go beyond the end of our array.And for each iteration, let's do a counter++ sothat the counter gets incremented.And now let's set up a block of statements to execute.And in that block we're going to need a variable that represents the particularkey that we want to target.So lets set style each time that the loops runs to the current property,and that would be the toyProperties array, andthe sub index of that, that matches counter.So, just to show you where we are, if we now console.log(style).And we clear and we run again.We'll see that this loop is running three times.Once for each of the elements in the toyProperties array.And the first time style is equal to color.The second time style is equal to size, andthe third time style is equal to shape.So now that we know that, we can output a sentence that describeseach of the different keys and values inside of this object.So in this case we can console.log,quote, The, concatenated with style.Then we concatenate that with another string space is.And then concatenate that with toy sub-element style.And just to be complete,we're going to concatenate that with a string that contains a period.Now what we're doing here is we're outputting the style, which we alreadyknow is going to be color, size, and shape as part of this console.log, andwe're also putting the value that toy object is storing on that key.And we're going to include that in this sentence.So now, if we clear and run, we get three sentences.The color is red.The size is large.The shape is round.And that's a heck of a lot to go through just to iterate through all ofthe elements in an object.There should be an easier way, and there is.
"For...In" Syntax for Object Properties

JavaScript provides a For...In syntax specifically foriterating through the elements of an object.The For...In iterator loops through each property in an object,assigning the property name to a given variable.And let me show you how much easier that is than what we just went through.We're going to start with the same code butlet's start getting rid of some of these things.For instance, we don't need the toy properties array anymore.We don't even need a counter anymore.In fact, we don't even need to declare the stylebecause we're going to be declaring that as part of our for loop.So now we're going to get rid of the forloop code in here, and instead of using the for statement we're familiar with,we're going to say for(stylein toy) and start another block of statements.And this block of statements right now is just going to contain the exact same codethat we had before for console.log.We're console.logging The style is toy, sub-element style.And if we clear it on that, we get the exact same result that we got before.Style is being assigned,each time we go through this loop, to a different key in the toy object.And we're using that key, first to pull out the name of the key, andthen later, to pull out the value stored on that key inside of the toy object.This is a much cleaner andsimpler way to iterate through all of the items in an object.One important thing to note is that you must not use the Dot Syntax
Don't Use Dot Syntax in Loops

when you're iterating through objects in a loop like this.The Dot Syntax will recognize the variable that you're passing inas if it were a property on the object.And it will look for a named property based on the name of that variable.So going back to our example, if we were to replace toy sub-elementstyle with toy.style, and we clear and run that,we would see that each time, we're getting the value of undefined for toy.style,and that's because JavaScript is looking fora property of toy that's called style, and we've never defined one.We have color, we have size, we have shape, but we don't have style.When looping through an object,you cannot use the Dot Syntax to access the sub-elements.Another interesting gotcha about objects is that the order is not guaranteed.
Order is Not Guaranteed

Unlike an Array,the properties of an object are not stored in any particular order.And so they can't be accessed in any particular order.You can't rely on them being in the same order that you define them.So when you're writing your code to iterate through the elements of an object,you should be prepared for the results to come back in any order.Make sure you write your code to keep that in mind.You may always see them coming back in the same order in your local environment, butthat doesn't necessarily mean every environment where JavaScript is runwill return them in the same order, so be prepared for that.

JavaScript In-Browser Tools

Another way that you can work with JavaScript files orwith JavaScript in general is through the in-browser JavaScript development tools.Most of the popular web browsers have JavaScript in-browser tools.For example, Internet Explorer has a Developer Toolbar.Firefox has an Inspector Console and a very popular plugin called Firebug.And Chrome has a Developer Tools console.Today, I'm going to be showing you a little bit aboutthe Chrome Developer Tools console andhow you can get to it, but the process is similar in other browsers.I'd like to show you how can work with your own files in the developer tools.We're going to start out in a text editor, just the way we have before.
Using the Chrome Console

And we're going to create a standard HTML file with a button, with an ID of say-hi,and a script,which will perform a console.log of hi whenever we click the button.The same as we've been doing console.log in our other programming environments.Now let's go over to a browser, go to the File menu andchoose Open that file, which we've saved conveniently on the desktop.And what we have is a webpage with a button on it that says, Say Hi.Now when we click the button, we don't actually see anything happening.But we know that that console log is there in the script.So how do we get to that?We know that our script has told us,log something in the console, with the word hi in it.But the Chrome Chrome Console isn't visible by default.In order to get to the Chrome Console in the current version of Chrome, you need togo to the View Menu, go to the Developer Sub Menu and choose Developer Tools.Let me show you how that works.
View the Chrome Console

So let's go to the View Menu and we'll choose the Developer andthen pick up Developer Tools.And a console will open at the bottom of the screen.Now this is going to show us all of the elements in the page by default.Chrome lets us view the source of the entire page and interact with the elementsin a number of exciting ways that are very useful for debugging.Some of that is beyond the scope of this course, butit's something you're going to want to learn about.Now as I said, we clicked the Say Hi button, butwe don't see any evidence of Hi showing up in the console.Well down here, in the Developer Tools there's a console tab.
The Console Tab

If you click on console, you'll see that a JavaScript console opens up.Up at the top of this console, you can see that the word hi is here.That's because we clicked the say hi button and that word showed up.If we click the say hi button again,you'll see the number two show up in front of it.That's because that particular command has been received twice.Click it again, and you'll see the number three.You get the idea.On the console, you can also see a little caret,that you might recognize from our tutorial on how to use node in the terminal.As you might hope,you can do all of the same things here that you can do in node In the terminal.Let me show you how that works.For example, I can type 2 plus 2, and it'll be interpreted as 4.Or, I can do console.loghello, console.And again, I will receive a hello console as my response.Having easy access to an interactive JavaScript interpreter in the browser isvery convenient, and it can help you if you want to try testing out a few examplesor experimenting with JavaScript.Especially, if you're in the middle of working with a web page.

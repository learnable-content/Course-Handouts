Introduction to "Switch" Statements

Now that I've taken you through if and else statements,you can see how conditional logic can be used to branch among different values.JavaScript has another way of controlling flow that's actually designed forthat sort of situation, the switch statement.
Multiple Possible Outcomes

Switch statements are designed to handlemultiple possible outcomes from the value of a single variable or expression.Switch statements can replace a pattern of using if andelse statements repeatedly if you want to test a single expression.We've already seen nested if andelse statements used together to branch across different possible outcomesdepending upon the value of a variable, such as color in this case.Switch statements are a way to structure code that's trying to accomplishsomething like this, in a cleaner way.I'd like to show you the syntax of switch statements.Switch statements use one statement to handle multiple possible cases fora single value, and this is the way that they look.We'll start by defining a variable, we'll call it color, andwe'll set it to a value of blue.Now we're going to create a switch statement.So we'll start with the keyword switch, and we'll pass it the variablethat we want it to switch on, and this can either be a variable or an expression.The switch statement takes a single block that contains a bunch of different cases,and depending on the value of color, one of these cases will be executed.So for example, let's say the case of color is blue.What we want to execute is going to come after this colon, and forclean syntax we're just going to indent that underneath there, and put console.logBlue is my favorite color.going to make that just a little wider, and then we're going toput in a break, and that's going to break out of the switch statement and move on.We might want to have another case as well.You could have a case of red,and we'll put a colon here andunderneath that one nested statement to execute, you can have one or more, andwe're going to console.log that's not as bad as green.And again, I'm going to make this just a little wider, just for presentation.And again, we'll break out of our switch statement, after we've executed that.And then we want a final case, and this one we're just going to call default.And we're going to console.log("Youhave bad taste"); and in thiscase we don't need a break because this will be the last statement in the switch.Now, if we clear and run this, we'll see that because color is blue,the switch statement checked color to see the value, noticed that it was blue, anddid the case of blue.Doing the case of blue means doing a console.log of blue is my favorite color,and then breaking out of the switch statement.If we change the color to red and we clear and run,we'll see that the switch statement now says, that's not as bad as green,and similarly if we change the color to green.If we clear and run, we just get, you have bad taste.And because this last case is the default case that'll handle anything other thanred and blue, we could put purple in here, and if we clear andrun, we still have you have bad taste coming out of the console.
"Switch" Statement Syntax

One of the advantages of the switch statement,is that the syntax looks a little bit less messy than having a bunch of if's andelse's together, but basically we're performing the same operations.The important thing with switch statements is to remember not to forgetthe break statements.If there's a break missing, the switch statement will go on andexecute the next case, and just to demonstrate how that can happen,let's go back to the code and see what happens if we get rid of our bricks.So let's get rid of the break after the case of blue andget rid of the break after the case of red.Now, we've got color set to purple.If we clear and run, we still just get you have bad taste, andthat's because blue and red were never triggered.But, if we change the color from purple to red, and then we clear and run.We see that what happens is red gets triggered, andwe get the console.log, that's not as bad as green.But because there's no break, we go on immediately to the default case,and we also console.log, you have bad taste.Similarly, if we had blue as the color, we clear and run again.Now we get all three cases being triggered,because there are no break statements, there's nothing there to kickus out of the block of code that the switch statement is executing.It may seem inconvenient, having to remember to put in a break statement everysingle time just in order to be able to use the switch.Using switch lets you set up structures that will allow you to execute
Selective "Break" Use

more than one case.If that's what you're going for.So let me show you one example of when that might be necessary.Imagine that we're using JavaScript to construct a compliment for somebody.We're going to create a variable called compliment.And this compliment is going to contain multiple adjectives.So let's create a variable called adjectives, and we'regoing to set that to an empty array for now, because to start with we don't haveany adjectives in our array, and let's create a variable called adjective count.It's going to set the number of adjectives to use in the sentence to see just howeffusive this compliment is going to be, and lets set it to start with three,because we want to be very effusive.To construct our compliment,let's set compliment equal to you have andthen, adjectives.join,with a comma and a space.You need to use a concatenation operatorin here, concatenated with tasteand an exclamation mark, and let's put a semicolon at the end.So you can see what we're trying to do here.Is we're going to construct a compliment sentence, and it's going to be based onthe number of adjectives that we have inside of the adjectives array.It's going to join those adjectives with a comma and a space, andit's going to stick them in the middle of the sentence to say whatkind of taste we think this person has, you have such and such taste.So, what we're going to need is a switch statement that's going to determine,based on the adjective count,just how many adjectives are going to go into the sentence.So, let's do switch of adjective count,and let's create a block of statements andlet's do a case of 4.And if it's 4, we're going to push an adjective into the array.So adjectives.push("exquisite").Now, because we want to combine multiple adjectives together,let's do another case right away, without a break statement.We'll do a case of 3, andthen adjectives.push("fantastic").In the case that adjective count is two,we want adjectives.pushamazing, and finally our default case.If adjective count is only onewe want adjectives.push great.So now let's go down here andconsole.log our compliment.And if we Clear and Run.What we see is our adjectiveCount was 3, so our switch statement pushed fantastic,amazing, and great into the adjectives array, andthen used the adjectives array, joined with commas to fill out our sentence.So you have fantastic, amazing, great taste.If you change our adjective count to 2, and we clear andrun, our switch statement goes to 2.Push is amazing, and then falls through to default and pushes greatinto the adjectives array, and then joins them together, and fills out our sentence.So sometimes you'll want to use break statements and switches, andsometimes not.Usually you will want a break statement between each case anda switch, and some JavaScript compilers will actually give youwarnings telling you that you need breaks between your case statements, butthe JavaScript will still work without them.

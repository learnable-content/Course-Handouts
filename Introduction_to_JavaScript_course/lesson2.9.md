Reference Types

So far, all of the variables that we've talked about have been primitive types.That meant that each variable could only store one value andthey pass their value by copying.I'd like to tell you now about reference types.Reference variables are more complex.They can carry multiple values and they used shared memory.I'm going to show you a little bit about how that works.One of the first reference types we're going to discuss is the array.
Arrays for Sequential Values

And arrays are forsequential values numbered from zero up to the size of the array.Arrays store multiple values in a single variable, and they let youaccess the values by specifying the index of the value that you want.Let me show you how that works.So let's create a variable.And let's call it words.And let's assign words a value.And in this case,the value we're going to assign is going to be between square brackets.And between these square brackets,we're going to type four strings separated by commas.The first string is going to be the word This.The second string is the word is.The third string is the word an.And the fourth string is the word array.Now, if we console.log the words variable,what we're going to get back looks exactly like what we defined.It comes back as an array of four strings.This is an array.But how would you access just the word this in this array?Well, let's do another console.log and again we're going to console.log words,but in this case we're going to follow words with square brackets.And between those square brackets,we're going to put the index number of the word this in that array.In this case, the index number of the word this is zero.So, console.log(words[0]); and if we go back here andclear and run again we'll see that the return value is the word This.Now, we can also change values inside of an array,just by assigning a new value to a particular index in that array.And I'll show you how that works.Let's type words and then square brackets.And put a 0 in there.We're going to put an equal sign.And we're going to put the string That instead of the string this.Now, let's console.log(words).And let's go back over here, Clear.And Run, again.And we'll see that the words array has been changed.Now, instead of this, is, an, array, being the four strings inside of words.Words is still an array of four strings, butthe first word is now "that" instead of "this".Being able to create a single variable that can contain an arbitrary number ofdata points each indexed by a number is very powerful.But the ability to store data that's that large comes with a bit of a cost.And JavaScript needs to be able to keep track in memory of where that informationis going to be stored, and the fact that it can grow to an arbitrarily large size.Because of this, unlike primitive variables such as strings andnumbers, Arrays are stored by reference.The value of an Array actually refers to a shared location in memory.And where this can get tricky is when you start assigning the value of an Arrayto another Array.When you assign the value of one Array to another Array,what you're actually doing is passing a pointer to that shared location in memory,from the first Array to the second Array.And if you make changes to the second Array,those changes are also going to affect the first array.Remember I told you primitive variables aren't the only kindsof variables JavaScript supports.Let me show you how reference variables work.
How Reference Variables Work

So let's create a variable, and it's going to be an array.It's going to be called words1, and we're going to set it equal to an Array,which is square brackets.And inside of those square brackets we are going to type four strings.This ,is, an,array.Now let's create a second variable and we're going to call it words2.And words2 is also going to be an array.In fact we're going to assign the value of words2 to equal words1.And remember what I told you about reference variables.What we've actually passed is a pointer in memoryto the location of the array that we've created for words1.So if we do a console.log(words1) anda console.log(words2), and we go over here, and we run that.We're going to see that both of these variables contain four strings, andthose four strings are this, is, an, array.But now, let's go back and change words 2.Notice we're changing words 2.We're not doing anything directly to words 1.So we go to words 2.And let's change the first index of words 2.That's the word "this".And we're going to set it to "that".So words2[0] sets equal to and then the string "That".Now, let's copy and paste our console.log commands from above.So we copy console.log(words1) and console.log(words2).And now, let's go clear and run this again.Now as we can see, the console do.log(words2) shows that is an array,just as you would expect.But the console.log(words1) also shows that is an array.This proves that arrays are reference variables.When you copy an array you're actually copying a pointer to the location andmemory where that array is stored.So changing the second array changes the first array as well.Knowing about this characteristic of reference valuescan help keep you from making mistakes that can cause difficultbugs to track down when you're writing JavaScript.Another nice thing about arrays is that they can store different types.You don't have to store just strings in an array.
Arrays Can Store Different Types

Another thing to know about arrays is that, when you add values to them,you start at slot 0.But if you add a value to an array, that's more than than one index pointpast the end of the array, the values that you skip will be filled in, andbe assigned the value of undefined.Let me show you how that can happen.So let's create a couple of variables.Let's create a var called things, andwe're going to assign it the value of an empty array.And an empty array is represented just by twosquare brackets with nothing between them.Next let's create a variable called words.And we're going to make that into an array as well.And this is going to be an array of two strings.The first string is another and a comma.And then the next string is array.Now let's start adding things to things array.Let's start with index zero of things.So things, sub zero.We're going to assign the value words.Words is actually the other array that we created.So one of the things inside of things is going to be another array.Lets assign another value, things [2] andwe are going to assign that the number two.And lets assign things [3] to the value true,which is a Boolean alue.So now let's do a console.log of things.And if we go over here andrun this, we're going to see that the first value in our array,things, is a another array, and it has those strings, another array inside of it.The second value in things is undefined.The third value, which is at index two of things, is the number two.And the fourth value, which is at index three, is the value true, a Boolean value.We can demonstrate this by doing console.log of the type of each of those.So, let's do a console.log(typeof(things[0])))using the optional parentheses of typeof.And let's just copy and paste this.We're going to do position one.We'll paste again.And we'll do position two, and we'll paste again, and we'll do position three.And, now, if we go over here in Clear and Run, again.We can see that the type of the first item,at position 0 in things is an object type.The type of the second thing in things at position 1 is undefined.The type of the third thing is number.And the type of the fourth thing at position 3 in things is Boolean.The ability of an array to store different types makes arraysthat much more flexible, and allows you to create nested data structuresthat can be very useful for representing complex data.Arrays also have a number of properties and methods.
Some Array Properties and Methods

And as we discussed before, properties contain data about the array, andmethods manipulate the contents of the array.To start with, I'm going to show you some of the accessors.There are some array methods that only access data in the arrays.And there are some array methods that modify it, or mutate those arrays.And I'm going to show you the difference between them.So, accessors return values from an array.First, is the length property, that tells you how many objects, oritems are inside of a single array.There's a toString() method that can convert the contents of an arrayinto a string representation.And there's a join() method that can also convert the contents of your arrayto a string, but allows you to define the separator that joins the elements.There are also some mutators that actually change the arrays.For example,the reverse() method will reverse the order of the items in the array.The sort() method will order the elements of the arraybased on the value that they have.There's a push() method that lets you add an item to the end of an array.And a pop() method that lets you pull an item off the end of an array.And I'm going to show you how these work with a sample array.So to start with, let's create an array called words.And we're going to put inside of that array four strings,these, are, some, words.Now, let's do a console.log (words.length).And if we go over here and we hit Run, we can see that length of our array is 4.That's how many items are inside of the array.Next, let's do a console.log(words.reverse()) andin this case we're putting the parentheses at the end because this is a method andit's going to do something to the contents.So if we go over here and clear and run again.We'll see that the order of the words in the array has been reversed.The last word's now the first word, and the first word is now the last word.Now let's go back and do a console.log(words.sort()).And this is going to do an alphabetical sorting of these strings.And since they're strings,it's obvious the order that they're going to be sorted in.So, if we go over here, and clear, and run again,we'll see that the strings in our array are now ordered alphabetically.Let's go back and do a console.log(words.toString()) method,and the toString method creates a string joiningall of the elements in the array with a comma separating them.So, we go over here, we Clear, and we Run again.We'll see that we get "are, some, these,words" separated by commas as a string.Now let's do a console.log and let's do (words.join()).And in this case, we're going to change the separator that we're using.So between the parentheses of the join method,we're going to put a quote and a space and a pound sign, andanother space, just so that we're going to use that as the separators.And now if we Clear, and Run again, we'll see that our array is being outputwith pound signs, and spaces separating each of the elements.Now, let's do a console.log(words.push()),and let's push the word augmented into the array.Now what do you think the result is going to be when I go over here andclick the Run button?Well, we click it, we'll see that the result of console.log for push is 5.What does five mean in this case?It's giving you the total number of items that are now part of the array.Remember, I told you that this is a mutator method.And this is actually changing the value of the array itself.Now let's go back and do another console.log.And let's do (words.pop()).And in this case, if we go back over here.And we hit Clear, and we Run, again.We're going to see that the result we get is actually the word augmented.It's pulled the last word off of the array, andit's returned it to us as part of the console.log.It can be a little confusing keeping track of what the output of push andpop actually are.The important thing to remember is that push adds an item to the end of the array,and pop pulls an item off of the end of the array.And if we go back over here, and we do a final console.log(words).And we Clear and we Run again.We'll see that what we pushed onto the array andwhat we popped off of the array are now no longer there.The array has been modified by the reverse and the sort that we did before.These are only some of the array properties andmethods that are available to you.But these are some of the most useful ones.And they're probably the first ones that you're going to want to take advantage of.
Creating Arrays from Strings

Now I've already shown you the two string and join methods,which can convert an array to a string.But there are also ways to convert strings to arrays.And this is convenient if, for example,you want to access the elements of a string and manipulate them.So there's a split method on strings.And the split method will let you break a string into an array of smaller strings.And it's pretty flexible.Let me show you how it works.So to start with, let's create a variable, and we're going to call it sentence.And we're going to set this variable to the string, this is a sentence.And let's create another variable, and we're going to call it odds.And let's set the value of that to all the numbers from one to nine,all of the odd numbers separated by commas.It's one, three, five, seven, nine.Now lets create a new variable called words andlets set the value of words to sentence.split.And inside of the parenthesis of the split method of sentence lets passa space between quotes.This is a string, that's just a single space.And what this is going to do, is break the sentence variable.Every place that it finds a space, andput anything that's not a space into the array elements of the new array words.We can also create another array.Let's create a variable called oddArray andlets set that to odds.split.And this time, inside of the split method,we're going to pass a string that's just a comma.And this is going to split the odds string,everywhere that there's a comma and put the elements that are between the commasinto the separate elements of the array.Now let's console.log those two arrays and show you how they look.So console.log(words) andconsole.log(oddArray).Now let's go over here and click Run.What we'll see is that words is an arraythat contains each of the words inside a sentence with none of the spaces.The spaces have been removed, because they were passed to the split method.Similarly, oddArray is an array of five elements, each of the odd numbers from oneto nine as a string which were separated by commas in the original odds string.Now, split will actually work on any value that you pass it.So, for example, let's create another variable, and we'll call this chunks.And let's use sentence.And let's set that to sentence.split.And inside of the split, let's pass a string with the letter s.And then, let's do a console.log of chunks.Now if we go over here and clear andthen Run, what we'll see is that we get an array with four elements.But the elements contain pieces of words andspaces, everything that's not an s inside of the sentence.Split is intelligent enough not to throw an error,if you send it a value that's not actually present in the original string.And to demonstrate that, let's go over here, and create another var.And we'll call that single item.And let's set that to sentence.split andlet's pass it the value the capital letter Q inside of quotes.And there's no capital Q inside of sentence.So now, let's do a console.log of singleItem.And again, let's go over here and clear and then Run.And you'll see that what we end up with is an array with just one string in it,and that string is the entire value of the original sentence.You can see how convenient it is to be able to create arrays from strings.But there are other ways that you can store data.
Objects for Key:Value Pairs

JavaScript also supports objects.And what objects let you do is store properties as keys and values.And rather than explain to you how that works let me just show you someexamples so you get it.Imagine that we wanted to keep track of the information about a toy.Let's make a var, and we're just going to call it toy.And what we want a toy to have,is information about the various properties that this toy could have.For example, its size, its color, and its softness.Well, let's try to create a data type that stores that information.Let's assign a value to toy.And in this case, because we're going to be creating an object,we're going to put the properties in between curly braces.And let's give these properties names.We're going to store the color.We're going to store the size.And we're going to store the softness.In order to establish the relationship between these properties and the values,after each one, we're going to put a colon and give each of these properties a value.So in this case, we're going to set the color to red.Then we'll put in a comma.We're going to set the size to 5, which is a number.Put in another comma.And then we're going to set the softness to true, which is a Boolean value.And I'm just going to move this over here so we can see it all on one line.Now, if you look at this, you see that we've described a toy.We've set the color to red, we've set the size to five andwe've set the softness to true.What this actually means in terms of business models doesn't really matterto JavaScript.All JavaScript needs to know is that we've created an object called a toy andwe've created these properties and these values for those properties.In this case, the property is called the key, and the value is the value.That's why an object is said to consist of key value pairs.Now, if we console.log this toy and we go over here and we Run.We see that what we get is information that it is an object of type object.And inside of it are three key value pairs.A color of red, a size of five, and a softness of true.But how would we access one of these properties individually?Very similarly to the way we accessed them with arrays.We're going to console.log(toy), and then we're going to put a sub value.Now if you remember with arrays,the sub value was a number indicating the index in the array.With an object, the value that we put between the square braces is the key forthe particular property we want to access.So, let's console.log the color property of toy.And if we go over here and clear, and run again,we'll see that toy's color is being logged out as red.Now, if you look down at the bottom of the screen,you'll notice that there are actually a couple error messages showing up.One error and one warning.First of all, it's telling me I forgot my semicolon on line 2.So let me just add that now.But it's also telling me on line 5, that color, as a property of toy,is better written with dot notation.Let me show you how dot notation works.We're going to console.log toy.color andit's exactly the same as console.log toy with a sub value of color.And I can demonstrate that by going over here andclearing and running again and as you can see, it gives us the same value, red.Now you can use the dot notation for any property that doesn't include spaces,but if you need to access a property that does have a space or if you need to passa variable to use as a property, you're going to want to use the square bracketsthe way that we did up here, and the way that you do with an array.Objects are one of the most versatile andflexible data types available in JavaScript.Objects form the foundation for JavaScript, which is one ofthe reasons why many people consider it an object-oriented language.
Objects Can Store Different Types

And an object, just like an array, can store different data types andwe've already demonstrated that.You can add properties to an empty object orto an existing object, just by assigning a value to that property.And you can assign any type of variable to any one of those properties.So let me give you some examples.Once again we're going to create a variable called toy andwe're going to set it to an empty object.And the reason that we create an empty object for toy is sothat JavaScript will know that when we assign a property to it,we're going to treat this variable as an object.So, let's give a toy a name, lets call it toy.name,and we're going to assign that cardboard box.While we're at it,let's give toy some tags the way that websites like to tag things.Toy.tags gets, andlet's give it an array of imagination andrecyclable, oops.Let's put that in quotes and cats.Now let's give toy a size.So toy.size and we're going to give thisan object, we're going to give it units forthe size and the units we're going to use are inches.And let's give it size of width of ten.A height of five anda depth of three.And you'll notice that the way we indented this object andput the commas after each item, except for the last item,you don't put a comma after the last item in an object or an array.We can even set inventory by doing toy.quantity and set that to two.Now, let's see if we can access one of those tags in toy.tags.We're going to do a console.log fortoy.tags, and because tags is an array,we can access the items in it by using the sub bracket notation.And let's access item number two, which is at index one of tags.And if we go over here and clear and run,we'll see that we've accessed toy which is this object we've created.The tags, which is this array, anditem two which is index one which is the word recyclable.And JS bin has reminded me that I forgot to put a semicolon here after this lineand let's access one of the sub-elements of the size.So we're going to console.log, toy.size,and we want to access the units, so .units.And we can use the dot notation because size is an object.So, if we clear, and run again, we'll see that toy,size, units has a value of inches, and that's what comes out.So, just like arrays, objects can store different types, andobjects can nest objects.Objects can store arrays, objects can store arrays that nest arrays,arrays that nest objects that nest arrays.You can create very, very complex data types using objects and arrays.And similar to arrays, objects are stored by reference.
Objects Are Stored by Reference

This means that just Its like an Array an object can be modifiedby any variable that is set to reference the same Object.When you said, a variable to be equal to an objectyour telling it to reference the location and memory where that object resides.So making changes to that new object will change the original object as well.Let me show you, let's go back to our first example where we create a tutorialand we set that toy equal to color red size five and soft to true.Now, instead of console.logging,let's create toy2, and set it to toy.Now, if we console.log toy.color andcopy and paste, we console.log(Toy2.color).And we go over here and Run.We'll see that they're both set to red.But if we change toy2.color to blue.And then we go back and copy and paste these down here, sowe're console.logging toy.color and toy2.color again, we clear and run again.We'll see that both toy andtoy2 have been changed to color blue based on just changing toy2's color.And again, this is because both toy and toy2 reference the same location inmemory, so changing one will change the other, unlike with primitive variables.So let me give you one more overview of the difference between primitive variables
Comparing Primitive and Reference

and reference variables.First of all primitives, they exist independent of each other.Each primitive can only have one value, and you cannot create properties ormethods on instances of a primitive.By comparison, reference objects, such as objects, arrays, and functions,which we're going to be getting to soon, can be of arbitrary size.They use a shared memory space, they can have one or more values.And you can create properties and methods on instances of reference variables.

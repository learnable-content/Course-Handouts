Math Operations

We had our first introduction to operators in our last lesson, butnow I'm going to take a deeper dive into the operators that deal with arithmetic.
Addition

I already showed you the addition operator, so you saw how a plus signcan be used for adding numbers or for adding or concatenating strings together.And let's just get a quick reminder of how that works.The plus operator when applied to numbers just adds them together.So if we console.log(1 + 1), and we run that.Obviously, we get two.Let's create a variable.We're going to call it smallNumber.We're going to set it to 2.And we'll see that we can alsoconsole.log(1 + smallNumber+ 3); or any such expression.And if we clear and run this again, we'll see that we get 6.But the plus operator applied to variables that are strings behaves a littlebit differently.We'll create a variable called firstWord, set it to hello.And a variable called secondWord, and set it to world.And if we go down here, andwe console.log(firstWord + a spaceinside of quotes which is string,and secondWord.And we go over here and clear, and we run, we'll see that when applied to strings,the plus operator concatenates the strings together, andcreates a string that contains all of the different strings as one string.Addition is one of the operations that behaves differently with numbers and
Subtraction

with strings, and also with combinations of numbers and strings.A more traditional arithmetic operation is subtraction.Subtraction only works with numbers, andlet me give you a quick demo of how that works.Let's start with the same example that we had here, andlet's add a variable called largeNumber.We're going to set that to 2000.And we'll clear away the rest of these examples.And let's console.log(largeNumber-smallNumber);, and if we clear and run,we'll see that the subtraction operator subtractsthe second number from the first number, as you might expect.But what do you think will happen if we try to do the same thing using strings?Let's console.log(firstWord- secondWord);.If we clear and run this again, we'll see that trying toapply the subtraction operator to strings gives us the not a number message.JavaScript won't report an error if you try to subtract the strings, butthe result that comes out might not be what you expect.Similarly, multiplication only works with numbers, and I'll show you that as well.
Multiplication

Again using the same variables that we set up before,let's do a console.log(smallNumber * largeNumber);.You can see Java Script, just like many programming languages,uses the asterisk to represent multiplication.So if we run this,we'll see that smallNumber mulitiplied by largeNumber is 4000, as we would expect.But if we console.log(smallNumber * firstWord);,What do you think we'll get?Let's clear and run that again.As you might have expected,we get not a number because you can't use multiplication with string variables.And you'll get the same not a number result if all of your variablesare strings, or if only one of your variables is a string.And similarly JavaScript supports division of variables as well, and
Division

again division only works with numbers.So if we go back to our example with the same variable set,lets console.log(largeNumber/ smallNumber);, andif we run that, we get 2000 divided by 2 is 1000, as you would expect.And of course, if we console.log(largeNumber/ firstWord),which is a string variable, we clear and we re-run that, we'll get not a number.In fact, if we console.log.(firstWord / secondWord);.And we clear and rerun that, you'll still get not a number because the divisionoperator decides that this is supposed to be a mathematical operation using number,and because these are strings, the result is not a number.You are probably already familiar with division, multiplication,addition, and subtraction before you started this class, butyou might not have been exposed to the modulus.
Modulus (Remainder)

Modulus is an operator that returns the remaining valueafter a division of numbers.And there are many situations in programing where figuring out bemodulus can be convenient.For example, if you want to find every third item in a list you canuse the modulus operator to determine when you’ve reach the third item sothat you can do something special with it.Let me show you how Modulus works.Let's go back to our example and let's change our smallNumber to 4 andour largeNumber to 10.Now, we'll remember ifwe console.log(largeNumber /smallNumber);, and we run that.The result we get is 2.5.But what happens if we console.log(largeNumber % smallNumber);.And notice that the modulus operator looks like a percentage sign.Let's clear and run that.We'll see that what we get is the number 2.That's the number that's left over after taking out as many complete versions ofsmallNumber that you can take out of 10, so in this case,four fits inside of 10 two times, leaving two as a remainder.Let me change the numbers just so you have a clearer example of how that works.If we change the small number to 3, we clear and we run again, first of all,largeNumber divided by smallNumber is 3 and a third, butlarge number modulus smallNumber is one.That's because three threes will fit inside of 10 leaving a value ora remainder of one.By performing calculations andusing conditionals to figure out when a modulus is equal to zero,you can find when the nth instance of any item shows up in a list.We'll get to more information about that later when we start talking about loops.
Increment and Decrement Variable

Two of the other convenient operators in JavaScript.Are the increment and decrement operators.Increment and decrement are represented by double plus signs or double minus signs.They're placed right next to the variable that you want to modify andthey either add or subtract one from the numerical value of that variable.Let me show you how that works.We'll start by creating a variable called smallNumber, we'll set it to 4.Let's console.log (smallNumber++),that double plus sign is the increment operator.If we run that, we see that we actually get the same value out, four.But now that we're run that,if we console.log(smallNumber) again to see what its value is.What's happened is this increment operatorhas added one to the value after reading the value.So, it output four, because that was the value when it began and then it added one.So now the value is five.Similarly, if we console.log(smallNumber--).This double minus is the decrement operator.What do you think is going to happen?We're going to run this and we're still going to get five.But if we copy and paste this and we run it again,you'll see that after the value was read from the variable.Its value was decremented by one and now the actual value is back to four again.The increment and decrement operators can be applied to variables after they've beenread or before they've been read and let me just demonstrate that for you.So we're going to go back to our previous example andlet's move these increment operators before the variablesand the decrement operator before the variable.Now we basically have the same example.We're console logging Increment smallNumber and then showing uswhat smallNumber is, then we're console logging decrement smallNumber andshowing us what smallNumber is.Now this time when we run,we'll see that the increment happened right before the variable was read.So, it came out as five.And of course, it remained five.And when we decremented, the decrement happened before the variable was read.So, it was changed back to four.And of course, it remained four.The increment and decrement operators are basically syntactic sugar, that meansa little convenience for programmers that lets them quickly add one or subtract oneto a variable, because that's something programmers need to do frequently.
Unary Operators

Another operator you probably haven't come across unless you've done some programmingbefore is the unary operator.Unary operators derive a positive or negative numerical value from a Number,from a String that represents a number, from a Boolean value oreven from a Null variable, Let me show you how that works.Let's start out by creating a smallNumber variable and setting it = 3.Now we can console.log the unary negative value of smallNumber.And if we clearly run, we'll see that the output is -3.The unary negative operator has taken the value of smallNumber,made a negative value out of it and returned it as -3.Similarly, we could make a string that contains a number.We'll call this variable numberString andwe'll set it to the number "33" and it's in quotes.Meaning that it's not a number, it's actually a string.Let's console.log.And this time we'll use a plus of numberString.If we clear and run again,we'll see that what we get is actually the number 33 not the string 33.And we can prove that by copying this line and pasting it down here.And doing a type of for numberString with the unaryoperator that's changing it to a positive number.If we clear and run again, we'll see that there's a syntax error.I left off the closing paragraph.But if we clear and run again, we'll see that the type of unary plus fornumberString, which was a string is now actually a number.But does that work for any string that has a number in it?Let's try var stringWithNumber andwe're going to set that to 33 Cherry Tree Lane.And we're going to console.log,we'll do the negative unary operator,(-stringWithNumber).We'll see what we'll get in this case.In this case, we get not a number andthat’s because "33 Cherry Tree Lane" could not be converted directly to a number.JavaScript doesn’t know how to derive a number from "33 Cherry Tree Lane".Although it does know how to derive a number from a string that just contains33, other variables can be converted to numbers not just strings.So let's create a variable called truth and we're going to set it to true,which is a Boolean value.And let's create another variable called falsehood,we're going to set that to false.Let's create a variable called,nullVar and we're going to set that to null.And let's create another variable called not defined andwe're not going to set that at all.Now let's console.log(+truth) andwe'll copy and paste this andwe'll change truth to falsehood.And we'll paste it again.We'll try it for nullVar andone more time for notDefined.And let's see what this unary plus operatordoes with all four of these values.So what we see here is we've got the previous values.Console.logging a unary value for truth gives us 1.A unary value for falsehood gives us 0.Unary value for a null variable is 0 also, but a unary value fornot defined variable comes back as not a number.Using the unary operators, you can convert any variable either into a number or intoits not a number value, if it's impossible to convert it to a number in JavaScript.
Precedence

Another topic to keep in mind,when working with arithmetic operators in JavaScript is precedence.Precedence is the order in which operations occur andoperations in an expression in JavaScript Are usually performed left to right withthe following operations given precedence, so that they happen before other ones.The top precedence is given operations that happeninside of parentheses within an expression.Next, the increment and unary operators are applied.Next multiply, divide and modulus are applied.And finally, add and subtract.And again, operations happen from left to right inside of an expression.So let me show you some situations, where you might encounter this precedence andneed to know about it.We'll start by creating three variables.A smallNumber, which we'll set to 4.A mediumNumber, which we'll set to 8.And a largeNumber, which we'll set to a 1000.Now let's console.log(smallNumber+ mediumNumber * largeNumber).So we have two operations happening, an addition operation anda multiplication operation.But we know from precedence rules that the multiplication operation should happenbefore the addition operation.So if we run this, we'll see that we get 8004.What happens is mediumNumber = 8 has been multiplied bylargeNumber = 1000 before adding smallNumber = 4.And that's because of the precedence, the order of operations.However, we can force that addition to happen first.By copying and pasting that same expression andputting the addition part inside of parentheses.Now parentheses have a higher precedence than multiplication.So in this case, if we clear and run again, we'll see that what happens issmallNumber plus mediumNumber, 4 and 8 are added together to make 12.And then multiplied by largeNumber, which is 1000 and the result is 12000.Let's see how the precedence rules apply to incrementers and decrementers.Let's do a console.log(smallNumber++* mediumNumber).Now if we clear and run this, we'll see that mediumNumber wasmultiplied by smallNumber, which is 8 times four and we got 32.But if we now console.log(smallNumber) and clear andrun that, we'll see that smallNumber has now been incrementedusing the increment operator and its value is set to five.So let's do another one.Let's console.log(largeNumber / by Andthen we'll use the decrement operator for smallNumber.And what do you think the result is going to be here?If we clear and run this, we'll see that we get 250.The decrement operator has precedence over the division operator andit gets called first before the division happens.So, if we console.log(smallNumber) now andclear and run again.We can see that it was converted to 4 and we can see that the decrement operator hadprecedence over the division operator, because it was converted to 4 before doingthe division, which is why we got 1000 divided by 4, which is 250.Instead of 1000 divided by 5, which would've been 200.It's worth taking some time to experiment a little bit with the rules of precedence.Go into one of your favorite testing tools and try a few of these out.See if you can predict what the result is going to be consistently,so that you're sure that you know what the rules of precedence are whendoing arithmetic with JavaScript numbers.

Introduction to Variables

Now, that we've had a brief introduction to some of the vocabulary for JavaScript,let’s take a deeper dive into variables.We’ve introduced the concept to the variable, but what is a variable?And how do we use them in programming?
Variable Defined

By definition, variables are named pieces of data,stored in memory, that can be written to, read from, and modified.In the example that we created before, we made a variable called example.In this case, the piece of data was the string "coffee", it was named example.We could write to it by assigning it a value of coffee.We could read from it by doing a console.log.And we can also modify variables once they've been created.
Symbolic

Variables are symbolic, that means that any variable can stand forany possible value of a single type.And we've talked about data types before.Variables are subject to change,you don't know from one point to another in a program,what a variable might stand for, or even if it's been assigned a value.And a variable can only refer to a single value at any given time.
Why Use Variables?

So, why do we use variables in programming?Let me give you an example.What if we had a program that did a console.log(2+2) andwe've seen before it that JavaScript interprets 2 plus 2 as 4.If we run this program, we can see that JavaScript outputs the value of 4.But what if we wanted to write a program thatcould console.log the values of two different numbers being added together,without knowing in advance what those two numbers might be.For example, what if we had a variable called first, and it had the value of 1.And another variable called second.And it had a value of 2.We could then do a console.log.Of first+second.And let's clear it and run again.And we can see that this is taking the value from first, andthe value from second, adding them together, and giving us the result of 3.As I've mentioned before, variables can be changed after they've been created.So, let's change the value of secondFrom 2 to 3, and then again doconsole.log(first+second).We clear and run again Andnow, console.log(first+second) down here gives us 4,even though console.log(first+second) up above give us 3.By using variables, we've made this line of code much more flexible because itdoesn't care what the values are.Every time you run it, it will figure out what values first andsecond have been set to, and do the calculation appropriately.As we get into more complex programming structures,you're going to see this comes in handy.
Characteristics of a Variable

So, what are the characteristics of a variable?First of all, variables all have names, and that's how you reference the data.Variables have a type,which is the kind of information stored in that particular variable.And that type can change as we've discussed,depending on what you've assigned the value of that variable to be.Variables have a value, and the value is the data stored in the variable.Variables also have a memory location, depending on the compiler you're using,JavaScript will store the value of that variable somewhere in memory.You don't need to know about where it's being stored, butyou do need to know that it's being stored somewhere.Variables also have a scope, when you're writing a complex program in JavaScript,sometimes there will be places in the program where the variable works, andother places where it hasn't been defined yet, or where it's not understood orrecognized.The scope of a variable helps you figure out where you can use that variable.Variables also have a lifespan, before a variable has been defined,it doesn't exist.Variables can also be destroyed, which ends their lifespan andthey can no longer be accessed.Lets talk a little bit about the steps necessary to use a variable in a program.
Steps for Using Variables

First of all, before you use a variable you have to declare it, that is you haveto tell the program that you're going to be using a variable of a certain name, sothat it knows that it exists.Second, we have to set that that variable to a value.And third, you're going to read the value.You might also change the value, you might delete the variable.There are other things that you could do, but these are the basics forhow you use a variable.Let me walk you through this, step by step.If you're going to use a variable in a particular scope,you want to declare that variable at the top of that scope.So, here I've declared a variable called first.It doesn't have any value, but it has been declared, and it exists in the scope.Next, I can assign it a value, first equals = 1.This assigns the value of 1 to the variable first.It also sets first as a number type variable.Now, if I want to do a console.log(first)the program that I'm creating knows to look in the variable first, find the valuethat it's been assigned, and when I run it, report that out to the console.This may seem pedantic I'm going very slowly step by step.But it's important to understand the difference between declaring a variable,assigning it a value, and then reading from it.There are a few reasons why this is so important to understand.
Why Declare Variables?

So, why do we have to declare variables before we use them?First of all, no matter how many JavaScript programs are runningsimultaneously, if you declare a variable on the Global Scope.Every single program that's running simultaneously, will be able to accessthat variable by name, and if you make changes to a variable that another programhas created, that other program isn't going to know that your program andthe other program aren't the same program.They're going to treat that globally scoped variable the same way.By declaring a variable, you define what scope that variable is available in, sothat you don't interfere with other programs.A lot of web pages simultaneously load multiple scripts from different sources,and if two different programmers who wrote two different programsboth created a variable called first, and they're both using it andchanging it, you don't know if the value of first that you're using is yours, orthe one that came from the other program.The reason that we declare variables first, as soon as we create a scopein JavaScript, is because of Variable Hoisting.We're going to get into this a little bit more later, but suffice to say that onceyou've created a scope inside of JavaScript, you want all of the variablesthat you're going to use declared right at the beginning of that scope.Because no matter where you declare them inside of that scope, the first timethe compiler runs into that piece of code, it's going to go and declare all ofthe variables that are needed in that scope before running any of the code.Since the ECMAScript 5 version of JavaScript,which has been in most browsers since 2014,a standard has emerged to add a use script string to the beginning of programs.This forces compilers not to allow variables not to be used unlessthey've been declared with the var keyword before they were used.It's also possible to declare and initialize a variable at the same time,by using the var keyword giving the variable a name, andassigning it a value all in one line.Let me show you how that works.In the example code we created before, we first declared a variable,
Declare and Initialize a Variable at Once

called first, then we assigned it a value, and then we logged it out.We can also create a second variable, called second,and instead of just declaring it on this line, we can assign it to a value.Now, we don't need a separate line to assign it to a value because it's alreadybeen assigned and declared at once, and we can log out the value of second.And by clearing and running again, you'll see that first is assigned down here, andseconds is signed up here, and when we console.log them,they both reflect the values that they've been assigned to.When you declare a variable, whether you want to assign it toa value at that time or not, depends on how you're going to be using it,sometimes you have no idea what you're variable is going to be set to.And sometimes you want to set it to a default value,which you may change later in the script.If that's the case, assigning it at the time that you declare it is a good idea.

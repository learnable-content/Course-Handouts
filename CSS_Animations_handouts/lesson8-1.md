I hope you've enjoyed this course on CSS animations! Along the way we've covered why you might want to animate, and discussed some principles you should keep in mind when you do. We then went on to explore the properties of transitions, keyframes, and animations, and put them together to create multiple animations.

We also covered some ideas of how you can make sure older browsers are not left behind. And ways we can design our animations to ensure they're accessible. The examples we've seen along the way are quite simple, but they can be applied to all sorts of animation. From explainer videos, interaction effects, or even just to add polish to a website; CSS animations are both versatile and efficient.

So what's next? Experiment! Have a go, and see for yourself what can be done with animation on the web. Sign up to CodePen and create some fun demos, and get to grips with what can be done. There's a world of motion to explore. Make mistakes, make discoveries, and have fun!

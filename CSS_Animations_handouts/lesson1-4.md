Before we get started, a quick word about the tools we'll be using. We don't need much to start adding CSS animation to our projects. All we really need is a text editor and a browser. I'll be using Sublime Text; it's available on Mac, Windows and Ubuntu. I won't be using any special plugins, so really any text editor will do. If you have your own preference, that's totally fine.

I'll be viewing the output in Safari. Again, it's not essential to use the same browser. You might be more comfortable using Chrome or Firefox for example, and that's also fine.

We will make use of some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. I assume a little knowledge of HTML and CSS; but there's only a small amount of JavaScript used, and I'll explain its use at the time. Ideally, you'll be familiar with basic HTML tags and how to apply CSS styling to a page. The focus of this course is to extend the CSS knowledge by introducing transitions and animations.

I'll be using the following structure in this course:

* Each example will have a single HTML file.
* Any CSS will be stored in a separate CSS file in the *stylesheets* directory.
* The file name of the CSS will match the HTML file name.
* Any JavaScript files will be under *javascripts*.
* In each case, we'll have a *start* folder and an *end* folder, in which you'll find HTML, CSS, and in some cases JavaScript. You're of course free to take a look at the end result if you like, but I would recommend playing along by opening the *start* folder in each example and coding along with me.
* I'm going to be coding without using the `webkit` or other prefixes on the `transition` and `animation` properties. The example code should include them though. And while prefixes are becoming less necessary over time, we do still need them for some browsers, so it's important to have a process where you either manually add in prefixed versions or use a tool such as Autoprefixer.

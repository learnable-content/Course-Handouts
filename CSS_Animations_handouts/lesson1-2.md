This course is all about bringing animation to the designs we create for the web. In this lesson, we'll discuss why we might want to do this, as well as some principles that might be useful as we create animations. And lastly, why we've chosen to focus on CSS animation in particular.

So why animate our UI? When we're designing web pages, we think about how they look, we think about the fonts, the layouts, the colors and we think about the content. But we also need to think about how people interact, and how our interfaces communicate with our users. When our interfaces communicate, things tend to change, we add new content or take it away, this is where animation becomes valuable.

As we communicate through our interfaces, we want people to notice and understand the changes. If new items are added to a list, we should make sure people are aware. When the status of something changes, again it's important that people notice.

How does movement come into this? Well, as humans we're very good at noticing movement. It's something we've evolved to be good at. It helped our ancestors survive, and it's a huge part of how we communicate. We use nonverbal communication to provide a very useful context for the interactions we have with other people. Also, in the real world things tend to move from one state to another.

We can hook into this and build on the fact that movement is very important to how we observe the world. When changing our UI for example, we can use movement to help people understand where the changes come from. We can use movement to draw the eye to important things, and we can use movement to entertain and to tell stories.

We can even use movement to add character to our designs in the form of personality. We can use movement to bring another dimension to our designs something that is lacking in flat pictures, and to make our work stand out from the rest.

In this course we'll learn about transitions, animations, key frames, and how to put them all together. But before we do, let's take a moment to consider some of the principles of animation, and how they can help us as we bring animation into our designs.

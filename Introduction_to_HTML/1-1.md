# Introduction

Welcome to Introduction to HTML course.

**HTML** is the markup language of the Internet: every website uses it in one way or another. It's a simple but powerful language that is used to structure and define content. And now we are at an exciting time when the new version of HTML, HTML5, has very good support across browsers and brings great opportunities for web development.

In this course you're going to learn the basics of HTML: 

* what the language is and how to use its main tags including texts, lists, structure, forms, and tables
* how to code semantic and clean HTML
* how to validate and test code compatibility

You are going to need very simple software to take this course:

* a browser, like Firefox or Chrome
* a text editor of your choice

You can find links for the recommended text editors in the lesson notes. That's it for this brief introduction â€“ let's start learning HTML!

# Conclusion

You made it to the end of the course. Congratulations!

I hope by now, you feel confident in employing advanced jQuery features, such as CSS animation, AJAX, and can comfortably use plugins for rapid integration of super cool features in your websites and web apps. Thank you so much for having me as your mentor for this course.

I'll be happy to see and review some of the projects that you build and I'm always available on Twitter and in the forums on Learnable to help you out if you get stuck along the way.

So, thank you once again and happy coding!

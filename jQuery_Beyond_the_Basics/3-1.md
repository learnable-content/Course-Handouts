# Introduction to AJAX

In this lesson, we'll talk about AJAX.To understand AJAX, let's go back a couple of years to the end 90s andthe early 2000s.Back then,a typical website's frontend was mostly limited to displaying static content.If a certain feature on the site had to be dynamic,then its processing had to be handled by the server.So let's say, you submit a form on the site, the contents of the form, andthe resultant page would then be generated by let's say,a PHP script running on the server.In all this activity,the entire page had required a reload once it was rendered on the server.Of course, from a user experience standpoint,I'm sure you'll agree that a complete page reload is not exactly enjoyable.The world has changed dramatically ever since.Today, we live in a world of fast andefficient JavaScript engines such as the V8 engine found in Chrome.Websites and web apps today access a whole world of third-party services, andcloud-based backend APIs.To streamline this process,modern day browsers use JavaScript to interact with these services.More specifically,we're talking about interacting with servers in an asynchronous fashion.So, imagine you click a button in a modern-day web app,that requires some processing and fetching data from a server.The request would be handled by JavaScript, which will then proceedto send the request in the background to the server in an asynchronous manner.Once the server finishes processing, it sends the result back in either JSON orXML, which is then parsed and rendered directly in the user interface sectionthat needs the data, rather than reloading the entire page.And, all of this is done by a set of technologies that are collectively knownas AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.Though the XML bit is something that is rarely used these days.Now, AJAX in itself is not rocket science, as you'll soon see.The reason why you would want to use AJAX on your sitesis the seamless user experience that it enables.No longer do you need to reload entire pages.AJAX let's you update specific portions of the page in a dynamic manner.As a quick recap to what I've just described, AJAX lets you fetch orsend data asynchronously in the background, allowing you to updatesections of your page, resulting in an overall better user experience.
History of AJAX:

A quick history lesson on the evolution of AJAX starts at Microsoftin 1996 with the introduction of the iframe tag.The iframe tag in HTML allowed content from other documents andpages to be embedded directly into portions on a single web page.This meant that those frames may reload the content withoutthe need to reload the entire page.Microsoft proceeded to implement the XMLHTTP ActiveXfeature in Internet Explorer 5, which was, really,the beginning of what would ultimately become AJAX.The XMLHTTP was adopted by Mozilla, Safari andOpera as the XMLHttpRequest() object,which is essentially the heart and core of what we call AJAX.A landmark moment in the evolution of technologies that lead to the rise ofAJAX was when Google introduced AJAX in Gmail, back in 2004.The term AJAX itself didn't exist in 2005,when it was first coined by Jesse James Garret.Finally, in 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium formally releasedthe first draft of technologies that are referred to as AJAX.But what we are really talking about here is essentiallythe XMLHttpRequest() object.This is responsible for sending and receiving data from a server,or a service in an asynchronous manner using HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
AJAX in action:

Let's try to understand this with an example.Let's say, you have a weather widget on your site which asksthe user to key in a city of their choice, so that they can see the weather updatesthat are fetched from a cloud-based weather service provider.Imagine this is a travel site and you want your customers to checkthe weather conditions for destinations that they are planning to visit.The user begins, lets say, by keying in the city andthe country name, and clicking the Get Weather button.At this stage, the XMLHttpRequest() object can be used to send the cityname as a JSON object to the weather service provider using a GET request.Remember, AJAX works well with GET, POST, PUT, andDELETE request methods, so it really covers the entire gamut of request types.Now, once the weather service provider returns data, it does soas JSON, which is then received on the page, andthe UI element's updated to show the resulting data.Sounds simple.Well, that's because it is.Let's examine this in terms of JavaScript code.And, for this example,
Implementing AJAX with JavaScript:

I'll explain it in pure vanilla JavaScript without bringing jQuery in the picture.We begin by creating a variable andlike many fellow coders, I like using xhr as the variable name.And, we'll set it to a new instance of the XMLHttpRequest() object.The next thing that we will do is invoke the open method,which accepts three arguments.The first one describes the request method, and in this case, we're using GET.The next one is the URL of the server, which needs to be called.And the last argument, which you've set to true, sets this AJAX call as asynchronous.So, once we've decided to perform an asynchronous GET request to our server,the next thing to do is use the onload event listener.This will be fired once the XMLHttpRequest()receives data from the server.Inside this function, as you can see here, we are simply parsing the results from ourserver which have been received, in this case, as a stringified JSON array.Specifically, these results are received through the xhr.response property.Now, so far, we have defined what the AJAX call should do, andhow should the data be treated once it is received from the server.What we have not done yet is invoke the AJAX request.To do that, we'll type xhr.send, and this gets the process going.I'm sure this has been relatively easy to understand.Now, jQuery really makes using the XMLHttpRequest() object andthe AJAX process a breeze.
Introduction to jQuery AJAX handling methods:

And it does so by providing us with powerful and easy shorthand methods,including a full blown AJAX method for advanced and custom configurations.And these are the methods that we'll see in this lesson.So, before we dive into jQuery's AJAX goodies,let's summarize what we've learned in the screen cast.
Summery:

AJAX is really a term for a set of technologies that let you load content andinteract with the server in an asynchronous fashion, andin the background.Thereby eliminating the need to reload the entire pagewhen dynamic content is needed.At its core, we have the XMLHttpRequest() object that supportsvirtually all HTTP request methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE,and allows you to load data as XML or in the more preferable JSON format.And, all of this can be easily incorporated in your website orweb app using jQuery.Let's see how.

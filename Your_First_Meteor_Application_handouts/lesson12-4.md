# Introduction

For the add player form to work as expected, we need to get the valueof the text field from the submit form event and into the create player method.This will allow users to create players with unique name fieldsrather than every player being named David.To do this, pass the playerNameVar variableinto the Meteor.call statement as a second argument,then allow the createPlayer method to accept this argument.Based on this change, we can now reference playerNameVar from insidethe method to reference the value that the user enters into the text field.This means we can pass the playerNameVar variable into the name field.As a result, the Add Player form will work as expected, butusers still won't be able to use the insert function from inside the console.But something that might not be obvious isthe fact that users can call methods from inside the console.For example, any user can execute the createPlayer method.And because the method accepts an argument,they can attach any value to the method.How would a user know that a createPlayer method even exists?Well, even after the application is deployed,users can simply view the source of the page and look through the JavaScript code.Depending on how we structure the project, we can make it sosome of the code isn't viewable in this way.But users will generally be able to view the code for the methods.As such, there's two problems we need to account for.First, we need to make sure users can only pass a string into the method.This will prevent users from entering a numerical value, or a boolean value,or any other type of data that might stop the application from working as expected.

# Using a Check Function

To do this, we can use a check function at the top of the method.Inside this function, we need to pass through two arguments.A value and the object type that we're expecting this value to be.In this case, we'll pass through the playerNameVar variable andwe'll match it against the string object type.Because of this code, if a user tries to execute the method by passingthrough a value that is not a string, an error will be returned andthe rest of the method won't be executed.The method will only execute if player name bar is a string.We'll talk more about check functions in another course, but forthe time being, it's only important to understand because of this function,users won't be able to pass unwanted data into the method.The second problem we need to account for is that currently,logged out users are able to call this method from the console.This means any user could fill the database with meaningless data thatisn't attached to any particular account.To fix this, create a conditional around the insert functionthat checks the value of the current UserId variable.This variable will return true if the current user is logged in, butfalse if the current user is not logged in.As a result, the insert function will only execute if the current user is logged in,which prevents anonymous users from calling the method andadding meaningless data to the database.

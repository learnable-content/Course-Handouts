# Introduction

Welcome to lesson three! This lesson is all about **numbers** and **logic**. First of all, we're going to do some arithmetic in IRB. Then, we're going to look at integers and their methods. And finally, we're going to find out how to create random numbers in Ruby. After this, we're going learn about logic and how to write conditional statements using the `if` statement, as well as using `elseif` if there's more than one condition. And if you have lots of conditions, we're going to look at using the `case` statements. Finally, we're going to create a guess the number program which will ask the user to guess a randomly chosen number from 1 to a 100. Then we're going to turn this program into a Web app using Sinatra. This will involve learning how to use sessions to store information.

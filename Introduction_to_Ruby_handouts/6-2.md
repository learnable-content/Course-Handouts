# Introduction

So far we've already seen lots of different built-in classes in Ruby such as `String` and `Integer`, as well as some of their methods. Ruby lets us add extra methods to these classes by opening up the class definitions.

# Integer Class

Create a new file `extensions.rb`:

```ruby
class Integer
  # doubles the number
  def double
    self * 2
  end
end



class String

  #make the reverse method useless
  def reverse
    "sorry no reversing"
  end

  # Make a string plural
  def pluralize
    case self
      when "woman" then "women"
      when "person" then "people"
      when "octopus" then "octopi"
      when "sheep" then "sheep"
      else self + "s"
    end
  end
end
```

I've opened up the `Integer` class by typing the keyword `class` followed by the name. Notice that it starts with a capital letter, which is true for all class names in Ruby.

Anything defined inside the block before the `end` declaration will apply to all integer objects. Inside this block, I've defined a new method that will apply to all integer objects called `double`. It will return the value of the integer multiplied by 2.

Inside this method we can see the `self` keyword, that refers to the object itself.

# Double Method

Now all integers will have the `double` method. Open up IRB, require your file and run:

```ruby
3.double
```

It should return the doubled integer that called the method.

You can add new methods for all of the built-in classes, such as strings and arrays. In fact, you can even redefine the built-in methods.

# Built-in Methods

For example, we can redefine the `reverse` method:

```ruby
def reverse
  "sorry no reversing"
end
```

Instead of reversing a string we just return this useless string.

Changing the way built-in methods behave is very much frowned upon since people expect methods to work in a certain way. So it's something that's usually best avoided. Remember: with great power comes great responsibility. It's very powerful being able to change class methods but something that we should try and avoid most of the time.

# Monkey Patching

Adding new methods though, that add more functionality is a good thing, and it's sometimes known as **monkey patching**. Ruby on Rails actually has a module called `ActiveSupport` which adds lots of extra methods to the `String` class amongst others.

# Pluralize

One of the methods in there is called `pluralize`, and it will return the plural version of a string. I've attempted to re-create this method:

```ruby
def pluralize
  case self
    when "woman" then "women"
    when "person" then "people"
    when "octopus" then "octopi"
    when "sheep" then "sheep"
    else self + "s"
  end
end
```

It uses a `case` statement to return the plural of some irregular words.

Now you can call

```ruby
"octopus".pluralize
```

to get "octopi".

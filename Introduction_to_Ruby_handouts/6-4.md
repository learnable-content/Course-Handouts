# Introduction

In the last step, we created an `Animal` class that allowed us to create lots of animal objects, all with the same methods. Now we're going to create two more classes, a `Rabbit` class and a `Duck` class. Create a file called *inheritance.rb*:

```ruby
require './animal.rb'

class Rabbit < Animal
  def hop
    puts "Hopping is great fun!"
  end
end

class Duck < Animal
  def swim
    puts "I'm quackers about swimming!"
  end
  
  def say_hello
    "Quack! I'm a duck called #{ @name }"
  end
end
```

# Concept of Inheritance

Because rabbits and ducks are both animals they will have many of the same methods found in the `Animal` class. So instead of duplicating all of the code from the `Animal` class what we're going to do is use the concept of **inheritance** to inherit all of the methods.

First of all, we need to require the file containing the `Animal` class.

Next we create the `Rabbit` and the `Duck` classes. This is the same notation that we used before except for this extra bit `< Animal`. It means that the class inherits from the `Animal` class and this means that it gets the same methods and properties.

What we can then do is add any new methods that are specific to these two new classes.

# Animal Classes

So I've defined a new method for the rabbit called `hop` because obviously rabbits like to hop.

Inside the `Duck` class I've defined a new method called `swim` because ducks like to swim, and this will amp up this string here.

We can also override methods that have been inherited from the `Animal` class if we want them to behave in a different way. So for example, you may remember that the `Animal` class had a method called `say_hello`. `Duck` class has this method redefined:

```ruby
def say_hello
  "Quack! I'm a duck called #{ @name }"
end
```

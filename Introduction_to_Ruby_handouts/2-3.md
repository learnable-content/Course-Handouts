# Introduction

It's time to write an actual Ruby program that uses strings.

# Gets Command

First of all, we need to create a file called *greeter.rb* with the following code:

```ruby
puts "Please enter your name:"
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello #{name}! Did you know that your name has #{name.length} letters in it and written backwards it is '#{name.reverse.downcase.capitalize}'?"
```

On the first line, we can see the familiar `puts` command.

On the second line, there's a new method called `gets` that stands for "get string". It will pause the program and wait for an input from the user.

# Chomp Method

Input will be a string and We apply a method called `chomp` to it. This strange sounding method removes the character that is added on to the end of any string when the Enter button is pressed.

Input data will then be stored in the `name` variable. We can then go on and use string interpolation and some of the string methods that we've just learned, to display information about the person's name.

The `length` method is used to show how many letters are in that person's name. I've also chained three different methods together, including the `capitalize` method which changes the first letter of the string into a capital letter.

# Testing the Program

Run your program in the terminal. The program is going to wait for some input because of the `gets` command. Type in your name and press `Enter`. Pressing `Enter` actually actually adds a new line character onto the end of the string, but we don't want that, so the `chomp` method removes it.

Lastly we just output this string and display some other information about it.

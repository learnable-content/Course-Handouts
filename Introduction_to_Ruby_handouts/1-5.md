# RubyGems

Ruby **gems** are libraries that help to extend the Ruby language by adding extra functionality. They're usually written in Ruby, although other languages such as C are sometimes used. There are literally thousands of Ruby gems available, that can help to add all sorts of functionality to your programs. 

# Sinatra

One particular Ruby gem that we're going to be using throughout this course is the Sinatra gem. This provides helpful methods that make it easy for Ruby programs to access the HTTP layer used by the web, which basically means that you can take a program written in Ruby and turn it into a web application with hardly any extra code.

# Installing the Sinatra Gem

To install any gem you'll need to use the terminal:

```
gem install sinatra
```

You will notice that other gems are being installed as well - these are all different packages that Sinatra uses to run. RubyGems will automatically ensure that any packages that are needed are also installed as well.

# Gems List Command

Once the installation is finished, we can check that everything went okay by typing

```
gem list
```

This will list all the gems currently installed on your system. You should Sinatra among the other gems installed.

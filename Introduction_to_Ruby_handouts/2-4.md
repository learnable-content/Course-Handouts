# Introduction

The next program is going to be a simple implementation of the game Madlibs. The idea is that user answers a variety of words and then they are put together to make a possibly humorous phrase.

To get started create a file called *madlibs.rb*:

```ruby
puts "Please enter an animal:"
animal = gets.chomp
puts "Please enter a color:"
color = gets.chomp
puts "Please enter an type of person:"
person = gets.chomp
puts "Please enter an object:"
object = gets.chomp
puts "Please enter an adjective:"
adjective = gets.chomp
puts "Please enter a verb:"
verb = gets.chomp
puts "The #{adjective} #{animal} started to #{verb} because the #{person} ran away with the #{color} #{object}"
```

This code uses multiple `puts` and `gets` statements to grab lots of data from the user. In the last line we use `puts` and string interpolation to display the information that the user has entered in a full sentence.

# Thank You

Thank you for joining me for this tour of JavaScript! We've gone pretty quickly through a number of the fundamentals and now you have a good grounding for understanding how JavaScript works and how you can interpret some of the scripts that you come across.

# What Did You Learn?

This course was intended as a broad introduction to programming concepts in general.

We went through some of the different coding environments that JavaScript can run in. Then we went talked about the syntax, variables and types that you're going to encounter using JavaScript. We talked about JavaScript operators, and we discussed JavaScript statements. Finally, we took a deep dive into functions and showed a few of the different ways that JavaScript uses functions.

Finally, I gave you a coding challenge. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do with it, and how your code looks. You should consider this a starting point for your explorations in JavaScript. Now you have the basic tools and the basic vocabulary for understanding how programming in JavaScript works.

# Best of Luck!

Go out there and look at programs that you want to understand better, and see if you can pick apart how they accomplish what they're trying to do. Best of luck in your coding adventures with JavaScript!

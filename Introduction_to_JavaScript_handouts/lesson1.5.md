# Online Testing and Development Tools

I'd like to show you one last way that you can experiment with JavaScript: online testing and development tools .You can work with JavaScript in the cloud using these tools. You can edit and manipulate JavaScript, see the results and even share those results with other people.There are a number of these online sandboxes available for testing and sharing your code.For example, JSFiddle, CodePen and JSBin. For the sake of this tutorial, I'm going to walk you through how to setup JSBin, but the others are similar.

# Setting Up JSBin.com

Open [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com). Turn on the JavaScript and the Console tab. Turn off the HTML and the Output tab. In the JavaScript shell you can do all of the things that you could do in the other JavaScript shells that we've discussed.

# Linting

One thing I'd like you to notice about JSBin is that it's setup to do linting or dynamic testing of your code while you're writing it. While you're learning how to write JavaScript, figuring out how the syntax works, this kind of linting or testing of your code is very convenient to have.

# Run Your Program

When you've written a program, go to the Console and click Run. Another thing I'd like to show you is how you can share a JSBin program.

# Share a JSBin Program

Everything you write in JSBin can be shared - you don't even need an account to do this. JSBin generates a unique URL every time that you start editing some code inside of the JavaScript window. If you were to copy this URL, create a new window and paste that in, it would bring you right back to where you were editing your code. You can also share it with other people.

So while you're learning JavaScript, JSBin is one more convenient environment you might want to consider for working through the tutorials and experimenting with your code.

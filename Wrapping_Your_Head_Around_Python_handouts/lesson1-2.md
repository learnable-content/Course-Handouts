# What's the Difference in Python Version 2 vs 3

In this course we're going to work with Python version 3, but when looking at Python 2, here's a few reasons you might want to use it.

There's more documentation, more libraries and modules, it does have more support so there's a larger community of people out there using Python 2 and that's just because Python 3 is newer. The community hasn't built as much around it.

Some of this may sound like disadvantages but now we're going to talk about Python 3 and we're going to see they're really not disadvantages. With Python 3 there's not as much documentation, but a lot of the syntax and the way you do things are very similar to Python 2, which is quite helpful. In a way, you're borrowing the Python 2 documentation to do things in Python 3.

With version 3 there's not as many libraries and modules. Is that really a disadvantage? Well there's not as many and the ones that are not there, you may find kind of obscure. They're not really libraries of modules that you would use anyway. They're kind of specialty, libraries and modules that are in 2 but are not in 3. For most everyone, for a lot of the code that you're going to write for Python, especially if you're doing web development, you're going to find as far as libraries and modules, everything is going to be there, everything you need is going to be there.

What about the community? It is smaller and it might seem as though there's not as much support. But I think you will also find that you can get the answer to whatever you want in Python 3 based on the documentation. Googling the question, you'll just find that there's a lot of resources actually out there.

Python 3 is the cutting edge of Python. New development goes on in Python 3 not in Python 2, so for this course we are going with Python 3.

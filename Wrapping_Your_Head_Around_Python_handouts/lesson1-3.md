# Setting Python Up on the Mac

Now we're going to look at options for setting up your local environment with Python. Visit [python.org](http://python.org) and open Downloads section. All you have to do is choose the distribution that works for you.

# IDLE

What you'll probably use mostly is **IDLE**, which is good for running small tests, small snippets of code. For the course I'm not actually going to be using IDLE because we'll be doing a lot of code.

# Python Editors

Instead what I am going to use an online editor [repl.it](http://repl.it) where you can easily run your scripts. Please note however, that program may run slower and it's not a true representation of the speed of Python.

# Windows Installation for Python.

Installing Python on Windows is easy as well - just open the Downloads section and choose the version that works for you.

Congratulations, you have reached the end of the course. I hope that you have learned a lot on how to write maintainable CSS and how to think in terms of architecture when it comes to creating CSS that lasts.

* We identified the goals of maintainable CSS architecture
* We went on and learned how to apply software engineering principles to write maintainable CSS.
* We got to know the separation of concerns, the open/closed principle, writing DRY code, and the single responsibility principle. Before getting to know these principles in depth, we also learned how to write specific, efficient, and descriptive CSS classes.
* We not only dealt with naming classes, but also with cascading classes in selectors. You have also learned how to establish a CSS hierarchy. This is important because you prefer writing your generic styles first and your specific styles last so that your specific styles have a chance to override generic behavior. This is how you can minimize the number of `!important` declarations inside your CSS.
* At the end of this course, we put theory into practice and created a small component library following the principles of the ITCSS architecture. 

We have covered a lot of topics in this course, and you can benefit from it the most if you put theory into practice yourself. I encourage you to create some repositories and start using a framework. Let it be ITCSS, or let it be SMACSS, or let it be your own framework.

If you get stuck with any topic, for instance, you don't know how to use Sass properly, just research SitePoint. I cannot emphasize how important it is to take some action after watching this course, because this is how you'll learn the most, this is how you'll benefit the most.

I hope you got some ideas that you can put into practice from today onwards. And this way, we will decrease the amount of unmaintainable CSS and the work together. Thank you for listening to this course from start to finish, and I wish you the best of luck with writing maintainable CSS.

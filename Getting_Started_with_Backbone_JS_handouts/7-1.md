# Introduction to Backbone's plugins

Welcome to the seventh and the last lesson of Getting Started with Backbone.js course! In this lesson we will discuss Backbone's **plugins** and integrate some of them into our application.

BackboneJS is a great library but it is pretty low-level and minimalist so programmer has to take care of various aspects while building an app. However during the past years members of Backbone's community created a whole bunch of various plugins to solve common tasks.

You can find full list of available plugins as well as Backbone's dependencies and development tools on this GitHub wiki page: [https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Extensions%2C-Plugins%2C-Resources](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/wiki/Extensions%2C-Plugins%2C-Resources). There is a huge list of various plugins for models and storage, plugins to build relations between models, plugins to power up your collections and much more. You should definitely take a look at it because many of them are really great and can make your life easier. Watch out, however, for an outdated plugins not compatible with the latest version of Backbone.

In this lesson we are going to integrate two plugins into our application: Validation to easily define model validation rules and StickIt to introduce data binding.

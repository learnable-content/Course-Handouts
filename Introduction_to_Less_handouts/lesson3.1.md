# Introduction

In this step I will show you how to download and install the Koala application - a Less compiler that we're going to be using to compile the Less code into standard CSS.

# Download Koala

Navigate to [koala-app.com](http://koala-app.com/) and click on the big download button. You can choose either version for Windows or Mac. After installation finishes, you can proceed.

# Koala Installation

Download course materials to the location which is convenient for you (either the Documents folder or the Desktop, for example).

You may grab a folder or a file and drag it into the compiler.

You can click on this row in order to expand the sidebar on the right. There is a list with different options:

* **Auto compile** is checked by default. This is going to allow it to compile the less code into standard CSS every time you save your file.
* **Output styles**. There is normal and compress.

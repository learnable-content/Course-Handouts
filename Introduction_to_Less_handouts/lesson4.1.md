# Project Overview

Welcome to the fourth lesson of this tutorial. We're going to building together the final project. That's going to to be the opportunity for you to apply what you've learned and to discover more advanced Less features.

We're going to start with the import directive,that's going to allow us to import external resources to the project. We will also see more of the namespacing and look at string interpolation. And as part of this chapter, I'm going to show you how to integrate mixins libraries, that includes a collection of built in mixins. That's going to allow us to build our templates much faster.

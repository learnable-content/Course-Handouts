# Designing the Email Optin Banner for Mobile

We'll be creating an email optin banner that allows visitors to sign up to our email list. In a similar fashion to the last Resources widget we made, we will be using blurred background tool on top of an image to create it, as well as create a shared style for input forms. Next, create a rectangle with a 16px height with a "Banner" shared style underneath the email optin.

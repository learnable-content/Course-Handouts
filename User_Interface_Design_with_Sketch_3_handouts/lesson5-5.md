# Designing the Footer for Mobile

We'll wrap up the mobile design by designing the footer area. This is the easiest section to create. Simple create different text layers for the footer menu links and align them into two columns. Change them to a mdium font weight, and create a text style of "Footer-Links". Next, we'll create the sub-footer links, by creating two text layers with a 14px font size, regular weight, character spacing of 1, and a color of #9B9B9B.

# Sketch Update

During the recording of this course, Sketch actually came out with a new version called Sketch 39. In this version, Sketch actually introduced a group resizing feature, which is going to make adapting to new screen sizes a lot quicker and a lot more convenient.

So make sure you upgrade your Sketch to the latest version and experiment with this new feature.

# Working with Color Palettes

While colors and branding are usually chosen by clients, we'll be doing this ourselves as it's our project.

##Contrast
Before you start with any color, you should get better with using grayscale design to create areas of focus. You want important elements to have a higher contrast with the background. Then, you can slowly start to add color to your. Don't use color as a crutch.

## Use a Base Color
Pick a single color to be the base of the color in your design. This color should be used most throughout your design.

In our project, we'll be using a shade of blue (Hex #4A90E2) as out base color.

## Use an accent color
Pick a color that goes well with your base color, it can be a complimentary color to your base color (that contrasts with your base color), or a heavy tint of it, it all depends on your design.

#Becoming a Better Designer

Throughout this course we've learned the basics of UI and UX design, we've obtained proficiency in using Sketch 3, we've learned the principles of web design, and lastly we've learned how to use a Project Brief. Now you should be able to create a visually appealing User Interface using a project brief in Sketch 3.

While you did learn quite a bit in this course, I want you to improve even further beyond the scope of this course, and here's how you can do it. There are a bunch of different ways to improve but these three things have helped me, and countless other designers continuously improve their skills.

First off is design challenges. You'll find things like dailyui.co which is a daily newsletter that you sign up for that gives you daily challenges straight in your inbox. It will include things like redesigning a login form or a add to cart button and small things like that, that keep your design skills sharp.

Next up are website redesigns. These are where you can go to your favorite websites and simply redesign them to the way that either you want them to look or you think would benefit its user base. Great examples for me are Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist.

Lastly, you have inspiration. This is where you go to look at other designers work and get inspiration. You can go to sites like Behance, Dribble, SiteInspire and Awwwards and look at what's popular and look at the types of, not just trends, but styles that are being used over and over.

Look at how UX patterns are being improved. And really get a sense and feel for what's being done or what's being made out there, and it will give you a really good idea of what direction you can take your design skills. And that wraps up this video.

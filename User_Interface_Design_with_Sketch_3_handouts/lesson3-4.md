# Creating a Desktop Wireframe

We will now wireframe the home page for the desktop screen size. The main from the tablet size wireframe is the the blog section is now expanded to two columns after the featured blog post. This gives the featured article more attention, as well as uses the expanded screen size of a desktop more effectively. Other differences are that the footer links are now all in one row.

As we're laying out the different components, we'll make sure to think of the principles of design we covered earlier. Even though this isn't the actual design itself, it still helps to make sure that we're laying a good foundation for it.

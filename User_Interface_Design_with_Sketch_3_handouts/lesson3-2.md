# Creating a Mobile Wireframe
In this video, we'll create a wireframe for a mobile screen size.

We'll start by creating the header navigation area with a dropdown menu icon using our iconset. We'll then resize it to 24x16px size.

Next, we'll create the post content, then the sidebar content area, finally we'll wrap up with the footer content.

We'll be using shared text styles to create several text styles for headings other types of texts that we'll use in the wireframes.

Shared styles allow you to repeat a certain style (color, shadows, borders, etc.) and sync them across other objects that have the same style attached them them.

We'll also go over symbols, which are actual objects that you can insert throughout your design and they'll sync up to the "master" symbol in the symbols page. Whenever you change the master symbol, the changes will be reflected wherever else you have the symbol posted. An excellent example for symbols are headers and footers that you can use through different pages in your project.

It’s important to note that we do not need to be precise with measurements of sizes or distances when wireframing. We’re wireframing mainly so we have an idea of where everything goes, not what font color, or specific size something is going to be.

#Course Overview

Welcome to User Interface Design with Sketch 3! In this course you'll learn how to use Sketch to design a user interface for a blog that we're gonna be working through. And, along the way, we're gonna learn things such as how to use a project brief, how to learn and use Sketch 3 and all of its useful plugins, how to wireframe our project before we start actually designing, how to design with a mobile-first approach, and finally, how to deliver our project to developers and clients.

So let's get started!

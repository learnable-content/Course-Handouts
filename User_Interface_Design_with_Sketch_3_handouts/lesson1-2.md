#Project Brief

A **project brief** is a document that summarizes your project and the process required to make it happen, as well as the goals it hopes to accomplish through this project.

Project briefs are typically given to you by an agency, if you're working for them as a contractor, or by clients themselves that have in-house marketing agencies. A project brief includes the scope of the project, the timeline, and the budget required to do it. For the purposes of this course, we're not gonna worry about timeline or budget, but we're gonna talk about what this design will accomplish.

In this course we're actually gonna be redesigning my own blog called Freelance Jump. The current challenges of this site is, it's a pretty ugly, bought off the shelf WordPress theme. It has pretty low traffic, and the users aren't really engaging it. Now, because of the ugly design and the users not engaging it It has a higher bounce rate, which negatively affects the SEO score.

So our goal for this project is to redesign the blog to increase the user engagement, decrease bounce rates. All while having a clean look and feel that's approachable and inspires creativity. So we're going to keep this goal in mind when we're designing our user interface. So in the next lesson I'm gonna be talking about Sketch, and how to use it, and how to set up the workspace so we can get started on our user interface.

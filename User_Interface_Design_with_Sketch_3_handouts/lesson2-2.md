# Sketch Workspace Setup
In this video, weâ€™ll set up the workspace in sketch. This will include preferences and installing some plugins.

## Sketch Preferences
We'll start off my going to Sketch > Preferences, and turn on pixel-fittings, and turn on strip text style when pasting.

Pixel-fitting makes sure that all your measurements line up to the nearest full-pixel so there's no unpleasant measurements like 125.57px.

Strip text style strips away all the styling when you copy text from other sources like a website and paste the text in a plain unstyled manner into sketch.

## Plugins
We'll use the following plugins to allow for a easier workflow:

- [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com) - This is app lets you speed up your plugins from github and isntall them automatically to Sketch.
- [Craft by InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) - This amazing plugin lets you create dummy content, duplicate layers in an intellgient way, and now even create prototypes!
- [Sketch-Measure](https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure) - This plugin allows you to create annotations on your design to let develoeprs know the exact measurements of different elements in your documents (i.e. the height of your header, the distance between to content areas, etc.)
- [Hipsterfill](https://github.com/sdrib/HipsterFill) - This is a dummy text generator that uses hipster buzzwords.
- [Nudge It](http://nudg.it) - This standalone plugins lets you adjust your nudge and big nudge settings. In Sketch, a nudge is where you move around an object using your arrow keys and a big nudge is Shift + Arrow Key for a bigger movement. Since I like designing on an 8-pixel grid, I like to increase my big-nudge amount to 16px.

## Fonts
For this project, we'll be using Helvetica Neue and Georgia, both system fonts available on Mac.

## Images
We'll be getting our images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), a photo library that includes high-quality creative commons zero (aka free to use) images for your projects.

## Icons
We'll be using the icons from http://ionicons.com

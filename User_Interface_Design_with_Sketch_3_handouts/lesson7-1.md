# Annotating Your Designs for Developers

## Congrats! You've made it all the way through the course!

This last section will show you how to:
- Annotate your designs for developers for a seamless design process
- Package and deliver Sketch files and assets to send to developers and/or clients
- Next steps you should take to become a better designer

## Annotate Your Designs
We'll be using the Sketch-Measure plugin to create annotations for sizes and distances in the design elements so our developer can use the exact measurements you created.

The main two tools you'll be using are "measure size" (Shift + Ctrl + 2) and "measure spacing" (Sift + Ctrl + 3). To measure size, you select an element, and click on "measure size", and you'll see an annotation pop-up. To measure the distance between two elements, select the two elements, and click on "measure spacing". 

Do this for all the main elements throughout the document on all three artboards. You don't need to show the distance more than one time for repeating elements (i.e. blog posts).

#Working with Icons

Now we will work with icons.

Sketch actually has built-in templates that you can access from File > New From Template. Some of these templates actually include icons. So we can open up something like Material Design. And go down and go to Material Design Symbols and they'll have plenty of icons for you to choose. But we're actually not gonna be using any of the built-in icons that we get, instead go to [ionicons.com](ionicons.com.) and press Download and get that. Open the *src* folder that has vector-based fonts.

Firstly, place social icons. Give them proper colors by going to [brandcolors.net](brandcolors.net). Here you can find colors that different brands use.

Lastly, place the clock icon.

## Mobile-first Design
Mobile-first design is a design process which involves designing for a mobile screen size first, then working your way up to a desktop screen size.

### Why Mobile-first?
As of 2014, there are more people accessing the web through their mobile devices than through a desktop. This means that it is necessary to make your website accessible and a user-friendly experience on a mobile device like a phone or tablet.

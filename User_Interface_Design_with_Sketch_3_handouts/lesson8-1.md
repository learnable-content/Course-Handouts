Welcome to section eight in this course. This section is added to reflect the changes in newly-updated Sketch 40.

New version includes vector-editing updates, a new text transform tool as well as some performance updates and bug fixes. As of this recording, Sketch 40.2 has come out and has fixed the performance updates bugs that came around with this Sketch 40 update.

In this section we'll talk about vector editing and in the next couple of lessons we'll see Text Transform as well as two new official Sketch plugins that are available today.

There are many useful updates, for example, you can hold the Shift key when dragging vector points to lock their movement in one direction. That really helps when you want to align things as you're creating them.

As you recall by pressing `V` you can create different vector shapes. A cool update here is when you select two different paths, you can just select them and drag over all points. You'll see that it doesn't matter which points belong to which object, it'll drag over and select any points that are in your selection. This really makes life easier when you're creating a multi-path vector object.

You'll also notice that when you're in vector mode, any points you hover over you'll see the cursor change.

Another thing is when you creating a new vector point, you'll see the exact point placement of where the vector point will be along the path. This is really cool and useful as well. One last thing with vector is, so when you have an open vector, you can just finish editing. Then when come back, you'll see that it starts off right where you left off.

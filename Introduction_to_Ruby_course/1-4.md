# Writing Ruby Code in File

Now that we've seen how Ruby works in IRB.It's time to write some Ruby and save it in a file.To get started, open up your favorite text editor.You don't need any fancy development software for writing Ruby.A simple text editor is just fine.All though, you might want to look for one that supports syntax highlighting.I've put some suggestions of different text editors in the resourcessection below.To get started, all we need to do is write the following code inside the file.Puts "Hello Ruby".This code is very similar to what we wrote in IRB earlier, sowe should get the same results when we run the program.To do this, first of all we need to save the file.I'm going to save it as hello.rb.And the rb is the extension that we use for all ruby files andI'm going to save it in my home folder.And as you can see when I save it, the text editor adds somesyntax highlighting because now it knows it's a ruby file.

# Testing Code

Now we need to open up a terminal and navigate to where the file is saved.Now I saved it in my Home folder, which is the default setting for the terminal.If you have saved yours somewhere else,then make sure you navigate to where the file is saved first.And then to run the program, all we need to do is type ruby anda space followed by the name of the file, which was hello.rb.And once we press Return, we can see the results of the program.As we can see here, it outputs Hello Ruby, which was the string we used.This is just like when we ran the same code in IRB earlier.The only difference is that IRB evaluates the Ruby every time that you press Enter.A ruby file allows you to enter multiple commandsthat will all be carried out when the program is run.We can see this by going back to our ruby file andadding some of the commands that we tried out in IRB earlier.For example we can add puts one plus one.And on another line, 3.times do.Pots "Ruby".Now we just need to add end.The end of that block.As you can see, we've got all these different lines of Ruby here.Now we need to save the file and go back to the terminal.And to run the program again, we just type in Ruby, followed by the name of the file.Hello.rb.And as you can see we press enter, we get the results of all the statements at once.

# Comments in Ruby

Now just before we go, I'm just going to add a comment to my Ruby file,I'm going to add it at the top.Now comments in Ruby, all begin with the hash symbol.And everything that follows the hash symbol is ignored.So if I add this in here at the top, you can see it comes in gray,which is the syntax highlighting again.Anything I write now will be ignored by the program.So we can write This is my first Ruby program.We can write, these are like notes, so we can write these in English,we don't need to use Ruby language for this.And comments are useful basically if you want to write information about whata program does and put notes in your code.And if I save this andgo back to the terminal and try running the program again.Ruby followed by the file name.Press enter.And you can see that the output is exactly the same andthe comment has been completely ignored.Well done.You've now written and run your first Ruby program.Our next job is to run our program in a web browser.But before we can do that, we'll have to learn how install a RubyGem,which we'll be doing in the next video.

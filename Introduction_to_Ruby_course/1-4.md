# Writing Ruby Code in File

Now it's time to write some Ruby and save it in a file.

To get started, open up your favourite text editor. You don't need any fancy development software for writing Ruby. A simple text editor is just fine, although you might want to look for one that supports syntax highlighting. I've put some suggestions of different text editors in the resources section.

Write the following code inside the file:

```ruby
puts "Hello Ruby"
```

Save the file as *hello.rb*.

# Testing Code

Open up a terminal and navigate to where the file is saved. To run the program type

```
ruby hello.rb
```

This is just like when we ran the same code in IRB earlier; the only difference is that IRB evaluates the Ruby every time that you press `Enter`. A ruby file allows you to enter multiple commands that will all be carried out when the program is run.

# Comments in Ruby

I'm going to add a comment to my Ruby file. Comments begin with the hash (`#`) symbol; everything that follows the hash symbol is ignored.

```ruby
# my comment
```

Comments are useful basically if you want to write information about what a program does and put notes in your code.

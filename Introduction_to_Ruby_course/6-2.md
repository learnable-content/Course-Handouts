Introduction

So far we've already seen lots of different built in classes in Rubysuch as strings and integers, as well as some of their methods.Ruby lets us add extra methods to these classesby opening up the class definitions.
Integer Class

In this file that you can see here that I've called extensions.rb,I've opened up the integer class and I've done this by typing in the key wordclass followed by the class name, which in this case is integer.And notice that it starts with a capital letter, which is true forall class names in Ruby.Anything defined inside this block before the end declarationwill apply to all integer objects.Now, inside this block,I've defined a new method that will apply to all integer objects called, double.And this will return the value of the integer multiplied by 2.And inside this method, we can see here the self key word, andthis refers to the object itself.So in this case, it will refer to the integer that caused the method.
Double Method

Now all integers will have this double method.Let's see this working.All I need to do is to go into a terminal and type in irb.Now I need to require that file extensions to rb.Now, because I'm in the same directory, I've saved that file to my home folder.All I need to type in is require, "./ andthe name of the file, which is extensions.rb.If I press Enter, we can access anything that's defined inside that file.Now, I can test out my new class method if I type in 3.double.It should return the integer that called the method.So, in this case, 3, and doubled.And we can see it returns 6.And I'll just test it out one more time for another integer.23.double, and it returns faulty 6.You can add new methods for all of the built in classes, such as strings andarrays.In fact, you can even redefine the built in methods.As you can see here in this file, I've opened up the string class here,and I've started to redefine the reverse method.
Built-in Methods

It's one of the first methods that we learned about.And what I've done is change it, to instead of reversing a string,to just return this fairly useless string here.And if we go back into irb, we can see now, the effect this has.If I enter a string, such as 'hello", and type .reverse, we wouldexpect to get "hello" written backwards like we did in the earlier lessons.But now I'll press Enter, I get this annoying message air returned instead.Now changing the way built in methods behave is very much frowned uponsince people expect methods to work in a certain way.So it's something that's usually best avoided.Remember with great power comes great responsibility.It's very powerful being able to change class methods butsomething that we should try and avoid most of the time.
Monkey Patching

Adding new methods though, that add more functionality is a good thing, andit's sometimes known as monkey patching.Ruby on Rails actually has a module called active supportwhich adds lots of extra methods to the string class amongst others.
Pluralize

One of the methods in there is called pluralize, andit will return the plural version of a string.I've attempted to re-create this method here soit's still inside the string class and I've got this new pluralize methodand this uses a case statement to return the plural of some irregular words.You can see here, when the string object is "woman", then return "women".And if it's "person", return "people".For "octopus", return "octopi".And for "sheep", then it returns sheep.And then at the end, I've got this nice catch all statement that says forall of the words just add an s onto the end.Let's have a look at this in action in irb.We can see,if I add the string "octopus".pluralize,press Enter, I get "octopi".And I can test it out with another word, for example, "book".pluralize,center and it adds an S onto the end.And remember book wasn't mentioned at all in that case statement, soit's using the catch-all add an S on the end.Now this is by no means complete, we can see this if I add"mouse".pluralize andpress Enter, it comes back with mouses, rather than mice.But, hopefully, this can demonstrate how powerful it can be to add in extra methodsto the built-in classes, and you can add some quite powerful extra functionality.This method could then be built upon and we could add in more andmore irregular nouns.That's all for looking at extending built-in classes.In the next video,we're going to create our own classes and we'll be defining some methods for them.See you then.

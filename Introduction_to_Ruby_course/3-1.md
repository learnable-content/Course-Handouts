# Introduction

Hi, and welcome to Lesson Three.This lesson is all about numbers and logic.First of all, we're going to do some arithmetic in IRB.Then, we're going to look at integers and their methods.And finally, we're going to find out how to create random numbers in Ruby.After this, we're going learn about logic and how to write conditional statementsusing the if statement, as well as using elseif if there's more than one condition.And if you have lots of conditions,we're going to look at using the case statements.And finally, we're going to create a guess the number programwhich will ask the user to guess a randomly chosen number from 1 to a 100.Then we're going to turn this program into a Web app using Sinatra.This will involve learning how to use sessions to store information.

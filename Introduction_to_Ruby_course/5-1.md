Creating Methods

Hi, and welcome to lesson five.In this lesson, we're going to look at how to create methods.We've already seen lots of different methods in the previous lessons, andthey've been Ruby's built in methods.In this lesson, we're going to have a look at how to define our own methods.We'll start by using IRB to learn how to define the method,and then we'll learn how to make the method more flexible by usingparameters that can include default values, and blocks of codes.After this, we're going to re-factor the "Play Your Cards Right" game thatwe created in the last lesson.This will involve using methods to make the code easier to understand andmaintain.We'll also look at using Sinatra's helper methods.Even though this won't actually change the functionality of the game,it will be a useful exercise in improving the quality of our code.

# Installing Ruby

Before we can start programming in Ruby, we need to install it. So let's get started and install Ruby.The installation processis a little different depending on which operating system that you're using.So I'm going to look at some websites that can help make the process a little easier.You can find all the links in the resources section below.If you're using Windows, then the best way is probably to use the RubyInstaller forWindows that you can see here.All you need to do is click on the Download button, andfollow the instructions.If you're using a Mac, then Ruby is already installed by default, although,it's probably not the latest version.To make sure you have the latest version of Ruby,then it's probably best to use Homebrew, where all you need to dois type in brew install ruby and then follow the instructions on the screen.

# Managing Multiple Versions of Ruby

If you want to manage multiple versions of Ruby oryou're using Linux, then the best option will be to use a version manager.Now there are many of these available including the Ruby Version Manager orRVM that you can see here, or rbend that you can see here.

# Command Prompts in Terminal

You'll find that most of the installations of Rubythat you need to use are command prompts in a terminal.This is very common, and you'll often find yourself using the command lineto install programs and rote commands when working with Ruby.If you're using Linux or OSX then it's likely thatyou've come across a terminal before and it looks something like this here.If you haven't used the terminal before, then don't worry.I know it can seem a bit scary and daunting at first.But you'll soon find there's nothing to it andit will quickly seem like second nature.We're going to use the terminal now to check that our installation of Rubywent okay.All we need to do is at the command prompt type Rubyfollowed by a space and a hyphen v, which stands for version.Now when I press enter, if everything has gone as it should,then we should see the version of Ruby that is being installed.And, as you can see here,I have Ruby version 2.2.2 installed, which is the current latest version.So now we've got Ruby installed.It's time to start some programming.

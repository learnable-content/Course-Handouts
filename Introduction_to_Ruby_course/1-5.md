# RubyGems

RubyGems are libraries of code that help to extend the Ruby languageby adding extra functionality.They're usually written in Ruby,although other languages such as C are sometimes used.There are literally thousands of Ruby gems available,that can help to add all sorts of functionality to your programs.One particular Ruby gem that we're going to be using throughout this course

# Sinatra

is the Sinatra gem.This provides helpful methods that make it easy forRuby programs to access the HTTP layer used by the web.Which basically means that you can take a program written in Ruby andturn it into a web application with hardly any extra code.

# Installing the Sinatra Gem

We're going to go through now to install the Sinatra gem now.To install any gem you'll need to use the terminal, as you can see here.All we need to do is enter the code gem install,followed by the name of the gem that we want to install, so in this case Sinatra.And then when you press Enter, you should see the installation process begin.You can see the information update in the terminal,as various different parts of the gem are installed.And as you can see here, there are actually other gems that are installed,for example, here the rack gem has been installed, and the tilt gem.And these are all different packages that Sinatra uses to run.And RubyGems will automatically ensure that any packages that need itare also installed as well.

# Gems List Command

Once the installation is finished, we can check that everything went okay,by typing gem followed by the word list.And if you press enter,this will list all the gems currently installed on your system.This list might be slightly different on your system, but you probably won't justhave Sinatra installed either, because Sinatra has certain gems that it dependson, and those dependencies will automatically be installed by RubyGems.If we look down the list, we can see here that Sinatraversion 1.4.6 has been installed.So now we're ready to start building our first web application.

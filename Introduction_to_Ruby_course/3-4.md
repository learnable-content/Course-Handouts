# Introduction

Now that we've learned a little bit about numbers andlogic statements work, we're going to write a short program that invitesthe user to guess a randomly chosen integer from 1 to 100.We can see the code for this program in this file here called guess_the_number.rb.In the first line, here, we use the rand method using a rangeof 1 to 100 as the argument to choose a random integer between 1 and100 and store it in a variable called number, that you can see here.This will be the number that the player needs to guess in the game.After this, we use the puts method to output a stringexplaining what the player has to do, here.We then use the get method here to obtain a guess from the player,and this will then be stored in a variable called guess, here.Now, even if the player enters a number,it will still actually be stored as a string.Everything that's entered using guess is stored as a string.So we need to add the to_i method at the end,to ensure that the value is treated as an integer.In the next line we create a variableto keep track of the number of attempts the player has had.And we set it to 1 initially,since this is the minimum number of guesses that a player can take.After this comes the main part of the program.Now, this statement here is a bit of code that basically says,until the guess is equal to the number, do all of the following.This is actually an example of a loop, andwe'll be looking at these in more detail in the next lesson.Now, inside the link is the actual code that will keep running during the game.And what we have are a number of if and else statements.So first of all, we have an if statement that saysif the guess that the player makes is less than the number,

# The Loop

then we'll use puts to output this message here,and it will say it's too small, try again.Then we use the elsif statement, here,to check if the guess is bigger than the number, there.And if it is, we'll output the message, it's too big, try again.The end value, here, marks the end of the if and elsif statements.So we're just checking is the guess too small, or is the guess too big?After we've given the feedback about the guess,we're going to increase the value of the attempt variable by 1.Because obviously, the player has had another attempt.Now this code here, which is a plus sign followed by the equals sign, isused to increment the value of a variable, in the case the attempts variable.And we're going to increase it by 1,because the attempts go up by 1 every time the player has a guess.Then we use gets again to ask for another value andthis will be stored in the guess variable.And it will replace the previous value and the whole process will start again,until the player guesses correctly.Once that happens, the program will break out of this whole loop here andjump to the last line of the program.And here we use puts to show a little message thatsays well done, you guessed the number correctly.And it will say how many attempts, using string interpolations, sowe insert the variable attempts here.And notice here at the end, we have a neat way of using an ifstatement to pluralize the number of guesses, if it was more than 1.

# String Interpolations

And what this is saying is add an s on the end if the number of attemptsis bigger than 1, otherwise this won't run.But remember, when you're using interpolation you don'tactually just have to use it to insert variables into a string.You can actually evaluate ruby code inside these curly braces as well,which we're doing here.And the s will only show if this variable attempts is bigger than 1.So that's a nice little method to remember for future.Okay, that's our program.Now let's have a look at it running.To do that, all we need to do is open up Terminal, andI enter ruby,followed by the name of the program, which was guess_the_number.rb.

# Running the Program

If I press Enter, first of all we'll see the message from puts.So, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100, try and guess what it is.So this line at the beginning, number=rand(1..100), will alreadyhave run so that will be stored in the variable called number in the background.And the get method is running here, and is waiting for some input from me.So I'm just going to guess right in the middle and go with 50.Once I do that, the attempts variable we set to 1, andwe'll go into this loop, checking to see if I've got it right.Now that's saying that guess is too big.So let's go smaller and try 10, which is also too big.So it's in the middle of this root loop now giving some feedback.It keeps checking the value of my guess against the variable number.So I'll go now with 5, which is too small.A bit bigger, 7.Also too small, so we'll go with 8.And that was the correct answer and you can see it broke out of this loop here andthe message at the end was displayed to say that it took 5 attempts,which we can see was correct.So everything seems to be working fine.And in the next video we're going to be using Sinatra to turn this programinto a web app.

# Introduction

Now we're going to use Sinatra to create a web version of the greeter programthat we created earlier.Most of the code will be the same.But the way that we get the input from the user is going to be different.There are basically two ways of getting user input on the web.From the URL string, or from forms.In this example,we're going to use the URL in the address bar to grab the user's name.

# Using Sinatra to Create a Web Application

You can see the code that we'll be using here in this file,called web_greeter.rb.As usual with our web programs,we start by requiring the Sinatra gem in the first line that you can see here.Then there's a route handler like the one we used before that you can see here.But the string in this route contains a value that starts with a colon here.This is called a named parameter.And these are special tokens in the route that can have any value.The volume, as entered here in the address bar,gets stored in the params hash that you can see here.This is a special container that holds any values entered by the user, andit works in a similar way as a variable.We're going to be covering hashes such as these in much more detail in lesson four.

# Testing the Application

Now remember that Sinatra outputs the last line of a route handler to the browser, sowe can see what the value of params name is,by opening up a browser, and seeing what is displayed.But before we do that, we need to start a server.So to do that, we open up the Terminal and enter ruby,followed by the file name, which is web_greeter.rb.And if I press Enter, we can see from this information here,that the server's started.So we can go ahead and open our browser.Then in the address bar, remember all Sinatra appswill start with localhost:4567.I enter forward slash, andthen whatever I enter here is going to be part of the named parameter.So I'll enter My name, Darren.And this value will then be popped into the params name.Then if I press Enter here,

# Displaying the Application in the Browser

we can see it's displayed in the browser.Now, if I just show the text editor as well, move the Terminal out of the way,we can see what's happening here is, in the address bar,this here relates to what goes there, in the route handler.So whatever appears after the first forward slash,then gets placed into this params hash.And it's repeated back in the browser.And if I change this, I put Jones for example, and press Enter.We can see that this is displayed in the browser instead.Going back to the code we can see thatthis symbol here in the named parameter is identicalto this here inside the square brackets of the params hatch.And these two have to match.Now let's update our code.First of all, let's assign the params name value to a variable.And let's call it name.So we write name equals, params name.So now we can just refer to whatever's in that params hash with the variable name.And now I'm going to add the string that we used in the Greeter program earlier.It's the same string as before, all it does is refer to this name variable,which remember, it's grabbed from the params hash,which is taken from whatever the user enters in the address bar.And it displays this message that basically says hello to whatever yourname is, and it uses the length method to count how many letters are in the name.And then uses quite a few methodshere to write it backwards using the reverse method.Write all lowercase and then capitalize the name at the end.Now if I save that, then I've actually updated the code.Now because I've updated the code I'm going to have to restart the server.To do this, we go back to the Terminal andwe need to enter, hold down the Ctrl key and press C.First of all, this will shut down the server, as we can see here,and then we need to restart it by entering once again ruby andthe name of the file and press Enter.And we can see that the server has restarted,so now the server is running again.I can go back to the browser.Enter my name here.And if I press Enter, I get the sentence I was expecting.So I get the message here, hello Darren,did you know your name has six letters in it, and written backwards, it is Nerrad.Which is just what I was expecting.So that has put the Greeter program onto the web.In the next video, we're going to change the Mad Libs program into a web app,that uses forms to enter the data.See you then.

Introduction

In this video, we're going to use arrays andloops to model a deck of playing cards.As you can see here, I have a file open called cards.rb.Now it starts by setting up an empty array here andassigning it to a variable called deck.Now, this will actually represent our finished deck of cards,it will be an array, but we have to start off by initializing this array,because we'll be referring to it later, so it has to exist.After this, we're going to use the fact that a pack of cards is made up of foursuits, and each suit has the same cards in it, from ace up to jack, queen, and king.So with this in mind, I've created two arrays,one to represent the different suits, that you can see here, andthe other to represent all the different values on the cards.Now I've used the shorthand notations for creating arrays, andit starts with this percentage sign and W, and that means that inside I don't needto put these values into quote marks, and I don't need to separate them by commas.And it's the same with the values array here,all these different values will just be created as strings, andit just saves a bit of time not writing the quote marks or the commas.
Nested Loop

Now after this, I'm going to loop through both of these arrays andI'm going to do that using a nested loop, which you can see here.Now you can see this starts off with the suits array andit uses the each method to loop through each value in the suits array,so hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades.However, straightaway, inside the loop,we have another loop, and this time we iteratethrough each of the values In the values array,again using the each method.
Inner Loop

Now, this is known as the inner loop, and the way nested loops work is that foreach value in the outer loop here, stays fixed,and we go through every single value in the inner loopbefore iterating on to the next value in suits.So to give an example, this will start off and it will set this value in the pipeshere, to the first value in the suits array which is hearts,so this suit will be set to hearts.And then what it will do is iterate through every single value,and what will happen is, we use this notation here to pusha string into our deck array.Now it started off at the beginning initialized as an empty array.Now what we're going to do is gradually push different strings into there, andthe way the strings are made up is, they will say the value of a certain suit.So the first string that will get pushed in to the deck array,will be hearts, from the suits array, andfrom the values array we will take ace and it will say ace of hearts.And then what will happen is we will stay inside this in a loop, andthis will increment to the next value in the values array and become two.But nothing will change in the suits array because we're still inside the inner loop,so the value of suit will still be hearts, andit will be two of hearts, andthen the next value will be incremented andwe will get three of hearts, then four of hearts,and we'll keep going until we get to jack of hearts,queen of hearts, king of hearts, and then we'll break out of this inner loop,but we won't break out of the complete loop.We'll just go back and iterate to the next value in the suits array,and that will become diamonds,and then we'll go back to the inner loop, and iterate to all of these values again.So we will have ace of diamonds, two of diamonds, andall the way up to king of diamonds, and then we'll move the suits onto clubs.And we will keep going until finally, We get to the value of suit is spades,and then we'll do the inner loop one more time, and we'll finish on jack of spades,queen of spades, and king of spades.And then finally, we'll break out of the whole loop andby then we should have populated this variable deck which startedoff as an empty array with every single value in a pack of cards.
Join Method

So just to finish off, what we're going to do is use puts to display this array butwe're going to use the join method to actually display it as a string,and we're going to separate each value with a comma.So let's test this out.What we'll do is open up a terminal, and if I just enter Ruby andthe name of the file, which is cards.rb,press Enter, and we get the output of this, File.And we can see here that like I said it started off with the suit sets of heart,and we've got ace of hearts, two of hearts, three of hearts, etcetera, andit keeps going, and then at this point this is when the inner loopfinished one complete iteration andthen we stepped up to diamonds and we go all the way through diamonds, andthen we change to clubs, and then we change to spades.So we have every volume of every card.The thing is, if we're going to actually use this,we usually would want this pack to be shuffled, and it just sohappens that Ruby has a very useful array method called shuffle.
Shuffle

So if we go back to our code here, and I'm just going to insert this extra line here,so before we actually display the deck of cards here,we're going to use the shuffle method.Now, I'm using the bang version of this method,there's a method that doesn't have a bang as well, butthat would just shuffle the deck of cards, but wouldn't actually change it.We want to actually change the deck of cards so that it's shuffled sowe need to use the bang method, which will change the array and keep it changed.And hopefully if I save this, and run it again,we should get a shuffled deck of cards.So all I need to do is type in again Ruby cards.rb, center,and we can see here we've still got of the 52 cards, but they're all mixed up.Starts with the seven of clubs, king of hearts,queen of spades, and goes all the way to the four of diamonds here.And that shows how we can use Ruby to model a shuffled deck of cardsthat can then be used in a game, andthat's exactly what we're going to be doing in the next video.

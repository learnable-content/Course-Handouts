# Numbers in IRB

Now we're going to have a look at using numbers in IRB.If I just open up a terminal and start up IRBwe can type in a sum, such as 4 + 5.And we can see this returns the correct answer of 9.What might not be as clear at first though, is that 4 and5 are both integer objects, and the plus symbol is actually a method.

# Dot Syntax

Now, we saw in the previous lesson how to call a method using the dot syntax,and you can do the same here.We would write 4, which is the object, followed by a dot,and then the name of the method, which in this case, is the plus symbol.And for this method, we also need to add what's called an argument,which goes in parentheses after the method name.And we put in here the number that we want to add to 4, which in this case is 5.And then we close the parentheses and press Enter.And we can see, this returns the same results of 9.So, 4 is the object calling the method, the plus sign is the name of the method,and here in parentheses, we can see the argument is 5.This doesn't look much like a sum, so Ruby lets us writethis in a more natural way, just like how we would normally write arithmetic.This is known as syntactic sugar,where a method can be written in a nicer looking way.So it's more usual for us to write it as 4 + 5,like we did in the beginning, instead of using the dot notation.

# Arithmetic Operations

Ruby has lots of other arithmetic operations,such as subtraction, so we can do 10- 4.Multiplication, 4 * 8.And division, 9 / 2.Hold on.

# Float

That last sum wasn't correct.9 / 2 should be 4.5, not 4.This is because 9 and 2 are both integers, andthis means that the solution to 9 / 2 will only give the integer part of the answer.So instead of 4.5, Ruby will just return the integer part, which is 4.To get the correct answer, we need to use a different type of number object,called a float.This is because that they use floating point decimals.To use floats instead of integers, all we need to do is write 9 as 9.0 instead.And now, if we divide this by 2,we can see Ruby returns the correct answer of 4.5.In this example, 9.0 and4.5 are both known as float literals.

# Odd or Even

Ruby also gives us methods to find out if a number is odd or even.For example, I can enter 42.even with a question mark on the end, and press Enter,and it will return true, because obviously 42 is indeed an even number.I can also use the odd method to check if 42 is an odd number.42.odd with a question mark on the end, press Enter.And it returns false, because, obviously, it isn't.Now in the last post, we learned all about bang methods.The odd and even methods are examples of Boolean methods.These are methods that only return the results of true or false, and they willusually have a question mark character on the end, which makes them easier to spot,like we can see here at the end of the even and odd methods.

# GCD method.

Ruby can also do some quite cool mathematical stuff,like finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the gcd method.So, if we wanted to know the largest integer that divides into both 12 and20, we would write the number 12.gcd,and then we would use 20 as an argument.Press Enter, and we can see the result of 4 is returned,which is because 4 is the highest number that divides into both 12 and 20.

# LCM Method

There is also a similar lcm method,which finds the lowest common multiple of two integers.So if I wanted to know the least common multiple of 15 and 20, I can write,15.lcm, and provide 20 as the argument.Press Enter, and we can see the answer of 60 is returned,because 60 is the lowest multiple of both 15 and 20.

# to_s method

One last integer method that we're going to look at is the to_s method,with stands for to string.It takes an integer and converts it into a string representation of that integer.For example, if I enter 7.to_s andpress Enter, we can see that it returns this string literal character,and we know it's a string now because it's surrounded by the two quote marks.This now allows us to treat the number like a string sothat we can use the string methods on it that we learned in the last lesson.

# to_i Method

There is also an equivalent method for strings called to_i,which changes a string into an integer so we can write 42,inside quote marks, which is a string, .to_i,and press Enter, andwe can see it now returns an integer object of 42.So, we can now use all the integer methods on it,like the sums that we were doing earlier.You have to be careful with this method, though,as if the string doesn't actually contain any numbers, then it will just return 0.For example, if I enter the string, "Hello," andput .to_i, pressing Enter will just return a 0.However, if you enter a string that starts with a number value,then it will return just that number from the beginning.So if I enter 221 B Baker St.inside quote marks, .to_i, and press Enter,we can see it just returns the 221 from the beginning of the string.It's often useful to generate a random number when we're programming.

# Rand method

This is easy to do in Ruby using the rand method.This will generate a floating point number between 0 and 1.0, like so.All I need to type is rand, and press Enter.And you can see a random number is displayed.We can keep doing this, and every time,we'll get a different random number between 0 and 1.If you provide an integer as the argument to this method,then it will generate a random integer between 0 andan integer up to the argument provided, but not including that argument.So if I write rand and provide 6 as an argument,then it will return an integer from 0 to 5,because 6, that's the argument, isn't actually included.So we can see we get lots of different random values, but never a 6.This is similar to rolling a number on a six-sided die,except we don't want 0 included, and we actually do want to go up to 6.Now, we could just add 1 to the result, butRuby provides a much nicer way of generating a random number from 1 to 6.What we can do is enter a range of values as the argument to the rand method.So we write rand, and inside the parenthesis we write 1..6.And these means choose a random number from 1 to 6, inclusive.And if I press Enter now, we can see we don't get zero anymore,and the random numbers go from 1 to 6.And this is now simulating the rolling of a six-sided die.That's enough about numbers.In the next video, we'll be looking at control logic.

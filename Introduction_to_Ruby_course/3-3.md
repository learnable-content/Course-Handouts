# How Ruby Handles Logic

Now we're going to have a look at how Ruby handles logic.As you can see here, I've got a file open called logic.rb.Now, the beginning of the file,I've used the rand() method to create a random number from 1 to 6.This is to model a number rolled on a die.And I've assigned this number to the variable called number thatyou can see here.Then I'm using the puts command to output this string,which uses interpolation to say which number was rolled.

# KeyWords

Now let's have a look at some logical statements that we can use to output someinformation about the number depending on if certain conditions are met.In the first statement you can see here,the condition is that the number has to be 6.And we're going to output this message to say that you rolled the highest numberpossible.Now the important command here, is this, if, keyword.This comes before the condition that has to be true,if we want this message to be displayed.And in this case, the condition is that the number has to equal 6.Notice here, that we're using two equals signs to test for quality.This is different from what we did here at the beginning,where we only used one equal symbol, and that was to assign a value to a variable.So, it's one equal sign for assigning values, andtwo when we're testing for equality, to test if two values are actually equal.We could also use a similar structure totest if a condition is not met as you can see here.It's a very similar structure, we want to put this message ontothe screen to say that you didn't roll the lowest number possible.And we want to do that, if, so we're using the if keyword again.The number, and this here, means not equal to.

# Bang Method

So it's the bang symbol or the exclamation mark followed by the equals sign.So this means the number is not equal to 1.And you'll only get this message here, if that condition is met.Now, in both of these cases, we have the condition coming at the end,and we have the code that we wanted to run at the start of the condition.We can put things in a different order.And we can put the condition at the beginning.As we can see here, we're saying, if, andhere's the condition, the number is less than 5.This angled bracket symbol here, means less than, andit's strictly less than, so 5 isn't actually included.This would just be the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.And we have to use another keyword, then, and then after the thenkeyword we put the code that we want to run, if this condition here is met.And in this case we want to use puts to output the string,you rolled a number less than 5.And if we use this style of structure, then we need to finish withan end command just to say that the if statement has finished.

# Writing Multiple Conditions

We can also write out multiple conditions on multiple lines.As we can see here, we're going to test if the number is evenusing the even method that we saw in an earlier video.And if it is, then we put what we want to happen on the next line.And if we do that we don't need to use the vin command.We're also going to use, else,here though, to put what we want to happen if the condition isn't met.So, this will happen if this condition here is met.So if the number actually is even,we'll output the message you rolled an even number.We write else, andwe write the code that we want to run if that condition doesn't happen.We want to say, You rolled an odd number.And once again, we have to finish off with the,end command, just to say that our if condition has finished.We can write as many conditions as we like,and as we can see here, in this next example, we havethree different conditions followed by an else condition if none of those are met.And notice again, we finish with the end command there.If we look here, because we're writing the statements on the same lineas the conditions, then we need to use, then, in the middle to join them together.And we're saying, if the number is equal to 1,then we're going to output the message, You rolled a one.And then we want to write another if condition, butonly if the first condition isn't met.And we can't use else because that willactually run just if the condition isn't met.What we want to do here, is put another condition ifwe haven't rolled the number 1, we want to know, have we rolled the number 2 instead?

# Elsif

And we use this keyword here, which is, elsif.Now, notice the spelling.It's e-l-s followed by i-f.There's no e in the middle here, where you might expect it.And then we have another condition.If number's equal to 2.And we'll put, You rolled a two.And now we want another condition.We want to use elsif again, and we want to test if the number was 3.because then we'll output, You rolled a three.Then we use else, which is kind of like catch all statement, sojust output that, You rolled a number bigger than three.This will run if these first three conditions aren't met.We can have as many else if conditions as we like.We can keep going and going.Although, it can get unwieldy.

# Case Statement

So, there is another statement we can use,which is a case statement, which you can see here.Now this works in a very similar way to the example above,but we use case instead of if.Now, the important thing here, is we put the variable number, because this casestatement, all the conditions in it refer to the value of this variable here.And like the if statements,we need to finish with an end to say that the case statement has finished.And everything inside is to do with the value of the number variable.And the way we set these out, is we want to say, when,the number is 4, then we want to do this.We want to output the message, You rolled a four.And the next line is, when, the number is 5,we want to output the message, You rolled a five.And when the number is 6 output the message, You rolled a 6.

# Else

We can also use else here, so we can use else andthen followed by some code to say what we want to do.If none of the statements inside this block of code herehappen, then we just want to say, You rolled a number less than four.Now these two structures are very similar.The case statement just a little bit neater andsaves you writing lots of else if statements.We can also chain to conditions together.As we can see here, we're testing two conditions.

# If Statements

We're going back to using an if statement.And we're saying, if the number is equal to 2, or,we got this extra keyword, or, here, the number is equal to 3 orthe number is equal to 5.So we're actually testing three different conditions.Just as you expect,the code here will run if either of those three conditions are true.So it tests each one.And only one of them has to be true for the code inside to run.Because we're testing the different prime numbers.If either of them is true, we're going to write, You rolled prime number.Now there's an alternative way of writing on that you can see here.And this uses the double pipesymbol to represent the word or.And we can see we've reversed the way we're going to write this again.So we've put the condition at the end, and we're goingto say You rolled a square number if number is equal to 1.And this is, or, the number is equal to 4.

# Double Pipe Symbol

Now there are some slight differences in using the double pipe symbol orthe actual word or, but they are essentially doing the same thing.There's also the, and, statement that only applies if both statements are true.We can see this here.We're going to check if the number is odd, and,we also want the number to be greater than or equal to 4.This here represents greater than or equal to.Earlier we saw how to test if something was greater than or less than.

# Greater Than

And if we use the angle bracket this way, this is greater than.If we follow it by an equal symbol, we're testing,if the number is greater than or equal to 4, so 4 will be included.So it could be 4, 5, or 6.But because we're also testing if the number is odd, then we're using, and,then both of these conditions have to be true.And the only number that will happen here is we will have rolled a 5,so we're going to output that message here.There's also a different way of writing and as well.There's a symbol version just like, or, and you can see it here.This uses the double ampersand symbol that we can see there.Again, there are some subtle differences between these.But generally, the double ampersand means, and, and you'll see this andthe double pipe symbol used quite a lot in Ruby code.And in this statement we're going to test if the number is even,and, if the number is less than or equal to 3.Now, if these two statements are both true, then the number has to be 2.

And we're going to output the message, You rolled the only even prime number.So, now we've seen lots of different examples of how we canput different conditions together in Ruby and runcode depending on whether these conditions are met or not, as the case may be.Let's just have a quick look now at this code running in IRB.We need to open a terminal.And I'm going to run that file,which is ruby, andthe file was called logic.rb.And if I press Enter,we can see the output of all those different conditions that we have.So the actual number rolled was a 4.And we can see here that it says we didn't roll the lowest number possible.That was testing to see whether we didn't roll the number one.We rolled a number less than five, which is true.It's tested whether it was even, and we rolled a number bigger than three,rolled a four, written in words and four is a square number.Let's just try one more time.And we can see if we run this.This time we rolled a five.Again, it wasn't the lowest number possible.This is an odd number, it's bigger than three.We can see all of these conditions have been met.It's a prime number.And it's telling us we rolled a five as well.That just about wraps up our video on logic.Have a go at running that code yourself, andrun it a few times to test all the different numbers.In the next video, we're going to look at putting all what we've learnedtogether about logic Into writing a complete program.See you then!

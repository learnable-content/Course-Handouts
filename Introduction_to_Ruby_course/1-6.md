# Creating a Ruby web application.

Our final task in this lesson is to create a Ruby web application.To get started, we need to create a new file,like the one you can see here, called hello_sinatra.rb.It contains the following code.The first line, require sinatra,is used to load the code from the sinatra gem that we installed in the last video.This will add all the functionality from the Sinatra gem into our program.The next part here is what's known as a route handler in Sinatra andit's an example of what's called a block in Ruby.Get signifies the HTTP verb that will be used by the browser to get the webpage.After this comes the string /hello.This is the route that we placed in the address bar in the browser, andtells us which page we want to get.And when this string hello is placed in the address bar,it will run the code in the block.Now the block starts with the do keyword and finishes here with the end keyword.So everything in between those two words is the block of code that we want to run.We're sticking to the same hello theme that we've used throughout the lesson,as you can see here.Except, this time, we're saying hello to Sinatra.We don't need to use the puts command this time, though, because Sinatra willautomatically output the last line of code in the route handler.And as you can see,this is a very simple route handler because this is the first and last line.Which means when we go to the hello route,then this piece of code will be run and it will simply output this string.This file is actually just another Ruby program, sowe run it in exactly the same way as we did before.

# Testing the Application

We need to open up a terminal, andwe just type in Ruby followed by the name of the file,which was hello_sinatra.rb.When I press Enter you should see something similar to this.Which tells us that Sinatra has started a web server andit means that we can now access the application in a browser.So let us go ahead and take a look.If you open up the browser.And in the address bar, you need to enter local host.Which is the domain that's used by web servers that run on your own computer.This application isn't available on the internet,just locally on your own computer.And then, we need :4567 which is the port that Sinatra uses.Then we need /hello, which,as you may recall, was the route that we used at the start of the route handler.Then when I press Enter.We see our familiar hello message, butthis time it's in a web browser instead of a terminal.We've successfully built a rather simple web application, congratulations!Sinatra has allowed us to adapt our previousprogram by introducing the concept of a route handler.The actual code inside the rare handler is very similar to what we used before.And this means that it shouldn't be too difficultto adapt any Ruby program into a web application using Sinatra,which is exactly what we're going to be doing for the rest of this course.Now, that just about wraps up lesson one.Be sure to check out the resources, and leave any questions or

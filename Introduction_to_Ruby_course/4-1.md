Introduction

Hello, and welcome to lesson four.This lesson is all about collections and loops in Ruby.In this lesson, we're going to look at some of Ruby's collections,such as arrays, hashes, and ranges.We'll look at what they are, what they're used for, and what they can do.After this we're going to look at loops.Which allow us to repeat the same code over and over again.We'll be looking at while loops and until loops.And then we'll learn how to iterate over a collection using the map and each methods.To finish off, we'll create a program that mimics the shuffling of a deck of cardsand then we'll develop this in to an online game of Play Your Cards Right,using Sinatra.

Introduction

In this video, we're going to have a go at creating our own classes.As you can see here,I've created a file called animal.rb and I've started to create an animal class.This starts with the keyword class, that you can see here.And it's followed by the name of the class, which in this case, is Animal.And it's important to remember that all class names in Rubystart with a capital letter.The class definition finishes here with the keyword end andinside the body of the class will be all the methods that belong to this class.One of the most important methods in a class is the initialize method thatwe can see here.This will be called every time a new Animal object is created.In this case, the initialize method has a parameter that we can see here.And it's called name and has a default value of Animal.This means that all instances of the Animal class will have a name.And the name value will then be stored in this instance variablehere that starts with the ampersand symbol.We saw instance variables used earlier in Sinatra.And an instance variable differs from a normal type of variable,because instead of being available just inside the scopeof the method where it was created, like normal variables,an instance variable is available throughout the scope of the class.So all of the methods inside the Animal class will have accessto this name instance variable.
Initialize Method

The last thing we do in the initialize method is use puts to output this messagehere, an animal has been born, wherever a new instance of the class is instantiated.Let's go into IRB now and take a look at how this all works.I open up the terminal to IRB.The first thing I need to do is require that file, animal.rb.And I do that by typing in require, it's in the same directory I was in,in my home directory, so I just need ./ and the name of the file,which was animal.rb.There I can see true is returned, sonow I have access to everything that's in that file.Now, to create a new object from the animal class,what we need to do is type in the name of the class with a capital letter,Animal, and then the new method.
.new Method

So it's .new and when I press enter, it will create a new animal object.And there we can see the initialize method is being run becausethis string has been outputted using the puts method.We can also see a return value here of the actual animal object.And it has this unique ID and also the name instancevariable has been set to Animal because that was the default volume.Now it's more common,when we create objects, to assign them to a variable.So let's try that again, and this time, I'm going to use the variable bob.I'm going to create a new animal, so it's Animal.new, but this time,we need to enter an argument for the name.
Method say_hello

I'm designing this so it's going to be called Bob.Only this time when I press enter, you can see we get the same message,but the unique ID is slightly different from the one before.And we can see the instance variable name has been set to Bob this time.And that instance variable will be available toall of the methods in the class.So let's go back to our class andadd a new method that uses this instance variable of name.We go back into the file, we can see here I'vecreated a new method called say_hello.Now this will output this string here.And it uses string interpolation to insert the name of the animalusing this instance variable, there, name.And you can see that's not mentioned at all in the method say_hello,it was created in the initialize method above.But instance variables, the important point is they're available to all methodsinside the class definition.So let's go back into IRB where we can check if the say_hello method works.I go back to IRB andI can type in bob.say_hello.And we can see that Bob says hello my name is Bob.Now we can see there that his name that was set.And that instance variable is being inserted into that string.So this saying hello method is working.
Add More Properties to Animal Objects

Now say we wanted to add more properties to our animal objects.We do this by adding what is called a getter method to the class.The name of getter methods is always the same as the property that we want to add.So say we wanted to add a property of speed to our animal class.Then we do this by creating a method like so.All we do is define a method, and because the property was speed,we call the method speed, and inside we can seethat we use an instance variable to set, orreturn rather, the value of that instance variable, speed.So now we should be able to call this methodif we want to find the speed of any animal objects.
Query Bob Object in IRB

Let me go back to IRB and we can query the bob object by typing bob.speed.That's the getter method that we've just created andit should get the speed property of bob.We can see it returns nil.This is because Bob doesn't have a speed property.
Setter and Getter method.

So, what we need is a setter method.Now, a setter method looks very similar to a getter method.You can see this underneath the getter method, here.This is a setter method.And what this has is the equal symbolalong with a parameter after the name of the method.Again the method has exactly the same name as the property we're setting.And then inside the method, we set the instance variable.Again it has the same name as the property,doesn't actually have to have the same name, but it's useful to do that.And we set it to the value that will be entered as the argument to this settermethod.This will now allow us to set the speed to a specific value using assignment.And we can see this if we go into IRB.We can type in bob.speed, and we can use assignmentusing the equal symbol to set the speed, and let's set it to ten.We can see we get that return value.And now we can use the getter method to query that property,and we can see it returns 10,and if we just type in Bob, we'll be able to see the actual objects again.
Shortcuts for Setters and Getters.

And this time we can see Bob now has an instance variable property of speed,and it's set to 10.Ruby supplies some shortcuts for setters and getters.Instead of having to write out the methods, all we need to dois use these lines of code here.So say we wanted to just for a getter method,instead of all of this method here that we did for speed, we can just use the lineattribute reader, although it's abbreviated to attr_reader.As you can see here, this will create a getter method automatically forproperty called strength.And if we want to then set this method,we use the attribute writer shortcut that we can see here.So these two lines of code here will allow me to get andset the property called strength.If we have a go with Bob, we can see bob.strength.And that doesn't yet exist, so if we actually set the strengthproperty say to five, I can nowquery that using the getter method that was set up with the attribute readershortcut that I used, and if I just have a look at the bob objectwe can see now strength instance variable has been set.
Attribute Accessor

And because it's very common to usually want to both get and set properties,there's also another shortcut that we can see here, the attribute accessor.And this will allow you to get and set properties at the same time, andyou only need one line.So I've just added this example, this will allow me to get andset a new property called agility.So if I go back to IRB, I can say bob.agility andI can set that, say, to 13.Hit enter and I can now query that as well.And if I just check the bob object, press enter,we can now see that agility property exists in the object.And that's just used with just one line herewill replace having to write both of those two getter andsetter methods, so it's usually much quicker to use this shortcut.And that completes our Animal class.
Lesson Wrap Up

As you can see, it begins at the top with this initialize method,which sets up everything that happens when the Animal object is created.And after this we can add any other methods, such as this say_hello method,and the instance variables can be used throughout the class in any ofthe methods and we also looked at how we can create getter andsetter methods in a variety of different ways.Probably the easiest way is to use the attribute accessor shortcut here.In the next video, we're going to be looking at inheritance.See you then!

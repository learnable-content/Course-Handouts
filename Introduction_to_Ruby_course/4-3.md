Hashes

In this video we're going to take a look at hashes in IRB.Hashes are a list of key and value pairs.We can create a hash literal by placing inside curly braces.For example, I can create a hash and assign it to the variable marge like so.Open up the curly braces andthen first of all I start with the key, which we'll use a symbol called name.And it's a symbol because it starts with the colon character.Then I use this character which is known as a hash rocket.And this is used to assign the value to this key name.And I want the value to be the string Marge Simpson.And then I just close the curly braces and press Enter.And here we can see the hash that I've created.We have the key here, which is the symbol name, andthe hash rocket assigns the string Marge Simpson.So this is the value, and this is the key.It's a common practice to use symbols for the keys like we've done here.This is because they use memory more efficiently than strings in Ruby.
Creating Hashes Using a Shorthand

Now, there's also a shorthand notation that can be used in Ruby to create hashes.And to demonstrate this, I'll create another one, andassign it to the variable homer.I still open up with curly braces,but this time I just type the key.Which is name, followed by a colon, andthen I enter the value.So name is Homer Simpson.And I'm going to enter some more key and value pairs into this hash.We don't have to just stick week one set of values.So we'll also add job, followed by a colon,which is going to be Nuclear Safety Inspector.And we'll have one more key value pair, which would be children.And that is Bart,Lisa, and Maggie.And then I close with the curly braces to finish the hash off.Now notice once I press Enter, the hash is displayed here.And even though I entered it using the shorthand notation,using the colon after here, and I didn't use any hash rockets.
Hash Rockets

Notice in the hash that's created that all of the keys are symbols.Even though they weren't created as symbols I put the colon on afterwards andthe hash rockets have been entered automatically.We can also use different objects forthe values as well, we don't just have to use strings,such as here we can see the value of the children key is an array.If we want to check that key exists in a hash, we can use the include method.So if we want to know if Homer has an entry for a job then we can use Homer,which is the name of the hash or it's the variable it was assigned to, dot include.
Boolean Method

And it has a question mark on the end because this is a boolean methodwhich is going to return true orfalse depending on whether he has a value for the key called job.And if we press Enter, we can see it's true,because we know we did enter something for that.To access the actual value and find out what the value is forthat key, we just reference the key.Very similar to using the index notation that we used in arrays.So if we want to know what Homer's job is, we can enter homer andwe use square brackets this time, and enter the name of the key.And it's a symbol, job close those brackets, press Enter,and we can see the value here which is the string Nuclear Safety Inspector.If we want to know how many values there are in a hashwe can use the length method.
Length method

If we type homer.length, press Enter,we get the answer of 3, because I entered 3 key value pairs.There was name, job, and children.You can add new values to a hash by writing the key that you want to add, andplacing it equal to its value.For example, if we want to add that Homer has a wife, we can write homer, anduse the square brackets again, andthe name of the key, which is going to be wife.I just place that equal to, and I put the value I want it to be.I want that to be the hash marge, andI use the variable we assigned our original hash to.And if I press Enter, we can seeit returns the hash that we created for Marge.Now, if I take a look at Homerwe can see this hash here, we now have the extra key value pair.And what we've done here is we've created a nested hash,because we have a hash inside another hash here.
Nested Hash

Now if we want to access the values of a nested hash we do thisby referencing each key in order.So if I want to know the name of Homer's wife I would type homer andsquare brackets with wife.And what I do then is close the square brackets andthen, open up some more square brackets for the next key which is the key insidethe nested hash that want to know the value of name key.Close the square brackets, press Enter, andwe get the value which is Marge's name, Marge Simpson, which is what we expected.That's all for hashes.In the next video, we'll be looking at another collection, ranges.

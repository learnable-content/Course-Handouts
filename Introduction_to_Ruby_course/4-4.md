Ranges

Now we're going to look at ranges in IRB.A range can be used to represent a sequence of values in order.We've already seen some examples of these when creating random numbers between twovalues, and for finding subsets of arrays.You can create a range by separating the start andthe end of the range by two dots, like so.If I write 1, two dots, and then 10, and press Enter,this will create a range of all the integers from 1 to 10.Including ten.Whereas if I use three dots like this.One, and then three dots and a ten.This will create a range of all the integers from one to nine.Ten won't be included.So, two dots is used for an inclusive range, and three dots is used foran exclusive range, where the last value isn't included.We can also create a range of letters.For example, I could create an alphabet of lower case letters, andassign it to the variable alphabet, using this code.Our alphabet equals, that's the variable.And then the range would be the string a,two dots, because I want all the letters included.And finish off with the letter z.If I press Enter, there we have our range, all the letters from A to Z.Unfortunately, you can't access the individual values of a range, butyou can with arrays, and hashes.So if wanted to know which letter was in position two of the range,I could try this.Alphabet, which is the name of the variable that refers to the range andsquare brackets and look at the index at two.Whereas you'll see when I press enter, I get an error messagebecause that isn't a method for accessing individual values in a range.
To A

Fortunately there is a handy method called To A,which stands for To Array, and this will convert our range into an array.So I can write alphabet_array,that's going to be the name of our new alphabet, that's in an array instead.And this equals alphabet, which is the range, remember?.to_a, when I press Enter,we can see here that now the whole alphabethas been converted into an array.And this includes every letter of the alphabet.So now I can use all of the array methods, including looking for that second value.So if I now try alphabet_array andlook for the index of two.Press Enter, and I get the output of c.This is because, remember, arrays start counting from an index of zero,so I've actually looked for the third letter of the alphabet there.Now, we've learned all about the different collections, such as arrays, hashes, andranges.In the next video, we're going to start looking at loops.See you then.

# What is IRB

Now that we've got Ruby installed, it's time to have a go at writing some code.We're going to use interactive Ruby orIRB, which runs directly in the terminal, like you can see here.To get started, all you need to do is open up the terminal andtype in IRB, then press enter.This starts an IRB session, like the one you can see here.Now, it's been a long-standing tradition when learning to program,to start with a classic Hello World program.We're going to keep with the spirit of this and write a Hello IRB program.

# Hello World

All you need to do is enter the following command.Puts, that's P-U-T-S,followed by a space then open quotes and Hello IRB.Close the quotes and press enter.And there you go. You can see the output of the program.It says Hello IRB.Congratulations.You've just written your first piece of Ruby code.

# Puts Command

Let's have a look at what happened.Puts is a Ruby command that stands forput string and the outputs a string of text to the terminal.This string that says Hello IRBis a Ruby object that stores the text in between the quote marks.You can have a play around at writing a few more strings in IRB.For example, we could write puts space andthen Ruby is fun and easy.Press enter and you can see the output displays below.I think, you get the idea now, but we've got an IRB open so

# Reverse Command

I thought I'd take an opportunity to take a look at some of the things we will belooking at later in the course and give you an idea of what Ruby can do.Don't worry if you don't completely understand what is happening at thisstage.We'll be covering everything in full in later lessons.The idea here is to see what a powerful and expressive language Ruby is.Let's start by starting a string of text backwards.This is as easy as adding the .refers method onto the end.So if we write puts, and then space,open quotes, Hello IRB.But then at the end we add .reverse.Press Enter and we can see this time the output is written backwards.

# Calculations

The dot notation is how we add a method to an object in Ruby.We'll be looking at strings and lots of other methods in lesson two.As well as text, Ruby can also deal with numbers.So we can write calculations such as 1 + 1, and you can see we get the answer of 2.It's just like having your own calculator because Ruby can do more complicatedcalculations such as 4- 6 * 2.And as you can see in the output,Ruby is perfectly happy dealing with negative numbers.It can even tell us if a number is odd or even.All we need to do is add the even method on the end.So, here we can say 2.even with a question mark,and we can see the output underneath says true.Because, obviously, two is an even number.We can put some of what we've learned together into a logical statement.Where write puts,open quotes, 2 is an evennumber if 2.even?And when we press enter, we see the output is 2 is an even number.This statement above is basically saying output the string,two is an even number if two is even, which is obviously is,so when I press enter we can that the string gets displayed underneath.What I like about this is that the program reads almost like an English sentence,and it's very clear what is happening.You'll often find that well-written Ruby code is easy to figure outwhat's happening, because it has such a rich and descriptive syntax.

# Logical statements

We'll looking at numbers, and how to write logical statements like this,in lesson three.A list inside square brackets is known as an array.Here's an example of an array containing some random numbers.Two, eight, three, and six.And we close the array with a square bracket.If we add .sort onto the end of the array, which is another method, thenRuby will sort the numbers into order, as you can see here if I press enter.We will be looking at how todeal with collections of data such as these in lesson four.Letâ€™s just finish offwith one last example to demonstrate the expressive nature of Ruby.If I enter 3.times do.Press Enter.Now nothing happens here because we're still building up the code andthe code hasn't actually finished.Then the next line of code is, puts Ruby!.And then press enter again and write end to finish this block of code.Now, before I even run this, try and guess what it does.Hopefully, it's not too difficult because it reads almost like English again.We're basically telling Ruby to do something three times.And if I press enter, we can see the result.Ruby! Ruby!Ruby!That's enough of IRB for now.But it's always useful to pop open an IRB sessionif you ever want to play around and test out some Ruby code.To exit, all we need to do is type exit.See, I told you it was simple.And that's the IRB session over.Next, we're going to look at writing and saving an actual Ruby program.

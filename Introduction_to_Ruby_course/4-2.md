Arrays

We are going to use IRB now to have a look at arrays.An array is an ordered list of objects.You can create an array literal by placing the objectsinside square brackets separated by commas.As you can see here I am creating a list of prime numbers.When I press Enter you can see the return value is the array here.You don't need to use numbers, though.You can also have an array of strings.So you can write an array of different fruits, separated by commas again,and inside quote marks we've got the different strings.Close the square brackets, press Enter, andyou can see the array is returned here.There's also a shorthand way for creating arrays of strings.This starts with a percentage sign followed by a w, andthen you can either use parentheses or curly brackets, to start the array.And the good thing about this,is you don't need to put the strings inside the quote marks.And you don't need to separate them by comments, a space will do.And I just close it with the same symbol that I used to open the array.So in this case, it's a curly bracket.Now press Enter and you can see it returns to exactly the same array as beforeand the quote marks and commas have been added in for us.You don't even have to use the same type of object inside an array.As you can see here.I'm creating an array that contains an integer, a string and a float.Now when I press Enter Ruby's happy to create this arrayusing the different types of object.You can even have an array that has arrays inside it.
Multi-dimensional Array

This is called a multi-dimensional array, andit's useful say creating a type of coordinate system.I can open up an array and then place another array inside it with a coordinate,say 2, 6, and closethat one up a comma and then a different array with a different coordinate,say minus eight two.Close that one and then I need to close the bigger array as well.And you can see when I press Enter we have this bigger array andinside the two different arrays that represent the coordinates.
Arrays in IRB

Arrays are a powerful tool in the Ruby toolkit, andthey have some very useful methods.To demonstrate these,I'm going to create an array that contains a list of items on my shopping list.I'm going to assign it to the variable called list.And I'm going to use the shorthand notation to create, andon my list I'm going to have apples, bananas,milk, and bread.And when I press Enter, we can see here's the shopping list as an array,with the four different items.To access a specific value in an array, we write the position of where it isin the array, in square brackets, this is known as the index.So if I wanted to find the item at position one I would enter the nameof the array, square brackets, and inside the square brackets I place the index.So I need to know what's at position one.Then I press Enter, and we can see bananas is returned.But notice that this isn't actually the first item in the array.It should've been apples, but it returned bananas.Don't worry. There's nothing wrong here.What's happening is that arrays start their numbering at zero.So if you wanted to know what the first item in an array is,you need to get an index of zero.If I press Enter, we can see that apples is returned.Which is the first item in the array.
Negative Values

The numbering system also used negative values to start counting from the back.So, if I wanted to find the last item in the list, I would enter an index as -1,and if I press enter, we can see bread is returned,because that's the last item in the array.There are also some specific methods for finding first and last items in an array.For example I type list.first and press Enter.The first item in the array is returned andif I use list.last and press enter I get the last item.
Subset Array

We can also return a subset of the arrayby specifying a second parameter with the index.This indicates the length of the sub-array that we want returned.So if I'm on to the first three items in my shopping list, I would enter list,and then I want to start with the first item which is index 0 andthen the second parameter is how long I want my sub list to be.And I want the first three items so I put three.Close the square brackets.When we press Enter you can see it returns an array of just the first three items.So this is a sub array of the list.Alternatively, we can supply range as the argument, like this.And I want to go from position 0, up two, which is two dots, position 2.And close the square brackets, and press Enter, andyou can see the exact same sub list is returned.If you want to know how many items are in an array, then we can use the size method.So I would type list.size and press Enter, andyou can see it returns the integer four because there are four items in the list.
Length Method

Another name of this method is the length method andlet me try a list.length and press Enter.We get the same result, there are four items in the arrayto find out if an array contains an object, we use the include method.So if I want to check if I have apples on my shopping list,I would write list.include.And it contains, it has a question mark on the end.This is because it's a Boolean method.And it's going to return true, if apples are on the list, andfalse if they are not in the list.It takes a parameter of what you are looking for, soin this case the parameter would be apples as a string.When I press Enter we can see it returns true because apples are in the list.Let's check to see if I have got cheese on my list.I would type list.include.Don't forget the question mark.And then, as a parameter, I would enter cheese.And this returns false, because cheese isn't on the list.If I want to add something to an array,I can add cheese onto the end of the list using the push method.This will append the string cheese onto the end of the array.Push, andit takes the parameter of what you want to actually push onto the end of the array.So, cheese, andthen if I press Enter, we can see it returns the full array.And right at the end here,we can see the string cheese has been added at the back of the array.There is a short hand operator fordoing this that uses double angle brackets like this.If I wanted to add chocolate onto my list, a quickerway rather than using the push method is to just enter it like this.
Push Method

And what's quite nice about this method is those double angle brackets almost looklike they're pointing towards the array saying push this string into the array.Then I press Enter,we can see now that chocolate has been added on to the end of the array.We can remove the list item from an array using the pop method.So let's just say that I've decided against getting the chocolatein my shopping and I want to remove it.All I need to type is list.pop,and I don't need any parameters to this method,because it will automatically just remove the last item in the array, andI know that's chocolate already.I press Enter.Notice the return value is chocolate.It's the string that you've removed.It doesn't actually return the array.So it's useful for gaining access to the last item in the array.But notice, if I look at the list now by just entering list and pressing Enter,it has been removed from the list.So the array doesn't contain the string chocolate anymore.
Sort Method

We can sort an array into order using the sort method.This will be sorted alphabetically.So we're at list.sort, and press Enter.We can see that it returns the shopping list in alphabetical order.This has not actually changed the order of the array though.You can check this by typing list again, and having a look.And you can see it's back in the original order that I entered the items.If I want to sort it for good andchange the original array, then I even need to use the bang method.So I will type list.sort andan exclamation mark on the end and now if I press Enterwe can see it returns the same arrays before in alphabetical order.This time if I take a look at the list again it is still in alphabetical order.So the array has changed for good.
Reverse Method

We can also use the reverse method to write an array backwards and this also hasa bang method so if I write list.reverse, and add a bang on the end andpress Enter then the list,the array now is in reverse alphabetical order.And if I take a look at it, it has stayed in reverse alphabetical order.One last method we'll look at is the joining method, which is very useful,because it can be used to create a stringthat joins all the elements of an array together.Now the list takes an argument to indicate what you want to be used as a separator.So if I write list.join and in the parentheses,I put a comma, this will create a string of all the items separated by a comma.If we press Enter, you can see a string is returnedand all the items are separated by a comma.And the order is as the order was before, reverse alphabetical order.That's enough about arrays in the next video,we're going to be looking at hashes.

# Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to use IRB to play around with some string objects andmethods.Open up the terminal console like the one we can see here andstart IRB by typing in IRB and pressing enter.

# Working with Strings in IRB

A string in Ruby is a collection of letters, or characters to be more precise.We create a string literal by writing a group of characters inside quote marks,like this.Then, when we press Enter, we can see the output here.We can also use single quote marks if we prefer.Although notice that the output still places the string inside double quotes.If you want to use quote marks inside a string literal,then you need to use the other type of quote marks.So if you wanted to use an apostrophe, for example, you can use double quote marks,and put the apostrophe inside the string, like this.And you can see in the output, the apostrophe is displayed.Another option, is to do what's called escaping the quotation mark.This is where you put a back slash before the apostrophe and then it will appear asif an apostrophe inside the string instead of terminating the string, like this.And then we use the \'s.This quote mark closes the string.When we press enter, we can see it displays properly here.In the last lesson, I mentioned everything in Ruby is an object.Objects can perform actions called methods.There are a few ways of getting an object to perform a method, but the most commonis the dot notation, where you write the object, in this case string Hellofollowed by a dot and then the name of the method that you want to call.So let's try calling the length method on this string.This will tell me the number of characters in the word hello.And when I press Enter,we can see the output is 5 because there are five letters in hello.Now let's move on to variables.These are very common in programming languages.They are a way of storing an object in memory for later use.

# Variables

In Ruby, we can assign a variable to an object very easily,using the equals operator, like this.Here The variable name refers to the string Darren.This means I can call methods on the variablerather than having to type in the string every time.When I press enter, we can see the output shows the value of the variable.So now if I want to a call a method, all I need to do is type in name.length.And it tells me how many letters are in my name.Now we have my name stored as a variable,let's try a few more different methods that can be used on string objects.For example, the reverse method should write my name backwards.And there you can see, that's my name written backwards.

# Down and Up Case Methods

There's also the upcase method, that writes my name in capital letters.Or the downcase method, that will write it in all lower case letters.There are loads of other string methods.You can find out what they all are by calling the methods method on any string.So if I type in name.methods it will show me all the differentmethods that the object can use.As you can see there are quite a few of them.You can find out more about them all by reading the documentation that can befound in the resources section below.

# Bang Methods

Now, all the methods that we've seen sofar haven't actually changed the object that called the method itself.For example, if I have a look at the name variable again by just typing name andpressing enter, we can see it's still the name I typed in originally, Darren.It hasn't been reversed and it hasn't been changed into uppercase characters.However if I create a new variable called fruit andstore the string apple inside that variable we can havea look at some different types of methods that do change the value of the string.And the way we do this is by using what's it called?Bang methods.These are methods that end in an exclamation mark or a bang symbol.So we can write fruit dot reverse you'll just find I think just bang on the end,when I press enter, we can see the result writes as apples backwards.But also, if I'll check the fruit variable.The variable has changed for good, it's been reversed andhas stayed reversed, and the string has been modified permanently.Most string methods have a bang equivalent.For example, there's also an upcase method with a bang on the end.So I can write, fruit.upcase with a bang on the end, and this will write.The result in capital letters, but also it will change the valueof the fruit variable to be in uppercase letters permanently,as we can see if I have a quick look at the fruit variable, it's still uppercase.If there is a bang on the end of a Ruby method, it usually means be careful,this method could be dangerous.In the case of the examples we just looked at, it means that the string will bechanged for good, so you need to take extra care whenever using a bang method.

# Chaining Methods

You don't have to apply methods one at a time.You can chain the methods together one after the other.For example, if I want to go back to my name variable andwrite it backwards and in capital letters, and can chain the reverse andupcase methods together, like this,name.reverse and then straightaway add .upcase.When we press enter this will have the effect of reversing my name andwriting capital letters all at once, as you can see in the results here.The two methods are applied in order from left to right.And although in this case it doesn't matter, in other cases it may,so make sure it,you have to be very careful about the order you chain the methods together in.

# String Interpolation

String interpolation is a neat way of inserting Ruby code into a string.This is done by placing the code that you want evaluated inside some curly brackets.With a hash symbol at the beginning as you can see here.And string interpolation starts with a hashthen curly braces and some Ruby code.And in this case I'm going to writename which is the variable that I created earlier.And when I press enter, you can see those string contains Darrenwhere it had the interpolated value herethat referred to the main variable and what's happening isthe value of that variable is being inserted into the string.One important thing to note is that when you're using string interpretation,the string must be a double quoted string.Single-quoted strings do not form interpolation.As you can see here, it just displays the actual string that was entered.We try to do what I did above.In single quotes, then all you get is an escaped interpolated value.It doesn't actually get interpolated.So, if you're going to use string interpolation,make sure that you always use double-quoted strings.That's enough playing around with strings in irb now.We should have covered enough about strings that we can nowwrite some programs, which is exactly what we're going to be doing in the next video.

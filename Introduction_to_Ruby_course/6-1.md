# Classes

Welcome to the last lesson of this course! We are going to discuss **classes**.

A class in Ruby is like a blueprint for creating objects and specifies all the methods that they will have. Classes are a fundamental part of **object-oriented programming**. To start with in this lesson, we're going to look at how to add new methods to the built-in `String` and `Integer` classes. After this, we'll be looking at how to create our own classes with our own methods. We'll also see how classes can inherit methods from other classes using the concept of inheritance. Finally, we are going to finish the lesson off by using what we've learned to create a deck class to model of a deck of playing cards, as well as a card class. Then we'll use these two new classes in our web-based play your cards right game, to make it more object-oriented.

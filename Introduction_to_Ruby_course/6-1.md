Classes

Hi.Welcome to the last lesson.This lesson is all about classes.A class in Ruby is like a blueprint for creating objects andspecifies all the methods that they will have.Classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming.To start with in this lesson, we're going to look at how to add new methods tothe built in string and integer classes.After this,we'll be looking at how to create our own classes with our own methods.We'll also see how classes can inherit methodsfrom other classes using the concept of inheritance.Finally, we are going to finish the lesson off by using what we've learnedto create a deck class to model of a deck of playing cards, as well as a card class.Then we'll use these two new classes in our web-based play your cards right game,to make it more object oriented.So what are you waiting for?Let's get started.

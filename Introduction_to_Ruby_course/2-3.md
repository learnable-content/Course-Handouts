# Introduction

Now we've played around with some strings in IRB.It's time to write an actual Ruby program that uses them.First of all, we need to create a file called greeter.rb.Now let's take a look at the code inside this file, and see what it does.

# Gets Command

On the first line, we can see the familiar puts command.That outputs the string, please enter your name.On the second line, there's a new method here called gets.This stands for get string and it will pause the program andwait for an input from the user.

# Chomp Method

This will be a string, andthen we then apply a method called chomp to that string.This strange sounding method removes the characterthat is added on to the end of any string when the Enter button is pressed.This input will then be stored in this variable here, called name.We can then go on and use string interpolation andsome of the string methods that we've just learned,to display information about the person's name.So as you can see here,the length method is used to show how many letters are in that person's name.And here I've chained three different methods together, including the capitalizemethod which changes the first letter of the string into a capital letter.So let's take a look at the program in action.

# Testing the Program

To run the program, we need to open up a terminal.And then, all we do is type in ruby,followed by the name of the program, which is greeter.rb.As you can see, when the program runs, we get the message,please enter your name, which comes from the puts command.If I move the window out of the way, here we can see the putscommand at the top here shows this message that we're now seeing in the terminal.And now what's happening is the program is waiting forsome input because of this gets command here.So if I type in my name, Darren and then when I press enter,it will actually add a new line character onto the end of the string.But we don't want that, so the chomp method, that's used here,will remove that character from the string.So all that will be stored in the name variableare the letters Darren I've just entered with nothing on the end.Press enter and we can see the outputted string,and we can see how string interpolation is being used.Instead of name.length here,we can see the number six is displayed, because my name is six letters.At the end here, we have my name written backwards.As you can see, the D has been made lowercasebecause we use the down case method which made all the letters lowercase, butthe N is a capital because of the capitalize method that we used afterwards.So each of these methods has been applied in the order that they are written there.And there we have it.It works just as we expected.

# Wrapping Up

Before you move on, have a go adapting this codeto use some of the other string methods to change the greeting given to the user.And in the next video, we'll be writing a madlibs program.See you then.

Introduction

In the last video, we created an Animal classthat allowed us to create lots of Animal objects, all with the same methods.In this video, we're going to create two more classes, a Rabbit class and a Duckclass, both of which that you can see here in this file I've called inheritance.rb.
Concept of Inheritance

Now because rabbits and ducks are both animalsthey will have many of the same methods found in the animal class.So instead of duplicating all of the code from the animal classwhat we're going to do is use the concept of inheritanceto inherit all of the methods from the animal class.Let's go ahead and take a closer look at our two new classes inside this file.First of all, we need to require the animal class using the require statementthat we've seen before.And this will allow us to refer to the animal class inside this file.Underneath this is the code for creating the rabbit and the duck class.Now this is the same notation that we used in the last video.Except for this extra bit that goes on the end here.This angle bracket is the notation that Ruby uses to say that the rabbitclass inherits from the animalclass and this means that both the rabbit class andthe duck class got the same bit of code here they will bothultimate access to all of the methods from the animal class.What we can then do is add any new methods that are specificto these two new classes.And we do this by defining some new methods insidethe class definitions just like we did in the animal class.
Animal Classes

So as you can see here, I've defined a new method forthe rabbit class called hop because obviously rabbits like to hop.And this will output the string here saying hopping is great fun.And inside the duck class I've defined a new method called swim cause obviouslyducks like to swim, and this will amp up this string here.We can also override methods that have been inherited from the animal class.And we do that if we want them to behave in a different way.So forexample, you may remember that the animal class had a method called say hello.I want the Duck class to also have a method called say_hello, butI want it to behave in a different way.And all I need to do is redefine the methodinside the Duck class like I've done here.And this will now output this string here,instead of the string used in the Animal class.
See How this Works in IRB

Let's go into IRB now and take a look and see how this works.So I need to open up a terminal, start up IRB andthen I just need to require the inheritance.rb file.That's true.Now, to create a new rabbit object, it works just like before.I'm going to assign it the variable bugs,because that will be the name of my rabbit, and he's Rabbit.new.And if you remember the animal class, took a parameter of the name of the object.And because the rabbit class inherits from the animal class,that also has to take a parameter, so we put the name, which is Bugs.We can have Bugs bunny here, and if we press Enter,you can see we get the same message that was from the Animal class,an animal has been born, but we can see that it's not an Animal class.It's actually part of the Rabbit class, as it says here, and we can see that it'sbeing assigned the name Bugs, using the initialize function from the Animal class.Now, we'll just check if the Duck class is working as well.And I'll call my Duck Donald.I'll assign it to the variable donald, Duck.new andthen the parameter of Donald.And if I press enter,we can see once again the initialized function which is from the animal class.Remember, that was not mentioned at all inside the rabbit and duck classes.We get this message here but we have a duck object.It has the name of Donald.Now, these two objects should have the methodsthat were added to the rabbit and the duck class.So if we check, first of all, bugs, so rabbit object should have the hop method.So I press Enter, we get the string outputted here,saying hopping is great fun!Now Donald should have the swim method, and he does.It outputs the string that says I'm quackers about swimming.Now both of them should have a say_hello method.The rabbit class inherited the say_hello method from the animal class.So if I type in bugs.say_hello,it should behave in exactly the same way, and it does.This was the same string that was outputted from the animal class.Donald, however, is a duck, and should have a slightly different string,because the method was overwritten inside the duck class.If I try this and press Enter, we can see that the string outputtedfrom Donald is different so the duck class has it's own version ofthe say_hello method because that was overridden inside the duck class.
Lesson Wrap-up

Hopefully, this video has shown how inheritance can be used to reproducethe functionality for more generic classes to make more specific classes.

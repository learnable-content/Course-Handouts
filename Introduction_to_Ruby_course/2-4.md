# Introduction

And my next program is going to be a simple implementation of the game Madlibs.This is where the user answers a variety of words andthen they are put together to make a possibly humorous phrase.To get started we need to create a filecalled madlibs.rb like the one you can see here.This code uses multiple puts andgets statements to grab lots of data from the user.You can see here, in the first line,that we're using puts to ask the user to enter the name of an animal.And then in the next line,we store the answer that the user gives in a variable called animal.And to do that, we use the gets and the chomp methods together.This happens for all the different questions.So next, we ask for a color, andthen we store the answer in a variable called color.Then we ask fora type of person and we store the answer in a variable called person.And so on for each of the different questions.We finish off in the last line using the puts command and string interpolation todisplay the information that the user has entered in a full sentence.We can run this program by opening up the terminal prompt andentering the ruby command followed by the name of the file which was madlibs.rb.And as you can see, it starts off asking me for an animal.I think I'll go for a duck.And then a color, let's have pink.A type of person, I'll choose a queen.And an object, I think I'll choose a pineapple.For an objective, let's try fuzzy.And a verb, I'll put dance.And if I press enter, I should get my sentence.There we go.The fuzzy duck started to dance because the queenran away with the pink pineapple.Hilarious.I'm sure that you can do better, but this is a good example of how to usevariables and string interpolation to display user entered data.In the next video, we're going to have a look at turning both of our programs thatwe've just written, into web applications using Sinatra.

# Introduction

Hello. My name is Bret Romero, and this is an Introduction to Swift course. We are going to learn Swift by building a real world app, rather than just looking at all of the language in isolation. It's going to make it a more interactive and an engaging course.

We will build an activity app, that allows people to log a particular activity and keep that log. Once they've saved an activity, they can click on the Performance tab and see a running total of their activity. They can also add activities, custom activities, that they can then log against.

# Learning Swift

There are a lot of good things in here that are going to help you learn Swift. We're going to get into foundational materials such as just creating the project. We'll set up the scenes and get into how you add UI elements and connect them to the back end so that data can then go into those UI elements and we can interact with them from our code.

We're going to look at arrays and how to create them, how to build classes, which are going to help us structure our data and manage it quite well. We'll get into some error handling so that we can gracefully handle scenarios that are somewhat expected and can happen. But we don't want the app to just completely crash, so we're going to have a little bit of control over those, let's say, a little more wild scenarios.

So I hope that you'll join me on this little journey, and I'll see you inside the course!

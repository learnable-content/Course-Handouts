# Starting the Project

Open Xcode and create a new project:

* Click File > New
* Select Project.
* Select "Tabbed application", click Next and give it some name (for example, "Activity Logger").
* Choose Swift as our language.
* Choose iPhone as a device.
* Click Next and choose a location. I recommend creating a separate folder for your project.

# Views

You'll have a bunch of tabs with views that were created for you. If you look at the bottom, you can see in the tab bar we have "first" and "second", which also correlates to the first and the second tab or items in each of these views.

Technically these views are called **scenes**. We'll get into this more as we go through the course, you'll see how we're adding UI components onto our different scenes and building them out.

# Course File Structure

In this step I will quickly explain the file structure for the files in this course.

All files are hosted on GitHub. Each lesson has a ZIP archive containing the starting files for that lesson.

# Starting and Finished Files

Click on "Diff Changes" to see the difference between the starting and final files. You can click on "Checkout Lesson" to see the starting files branch on GitHub.

You can also download the ZIP archive or change to another branch and download the finished exercise.

# Sample Media Files

In the *media* folder inside each lesson, you'll find the sample media for each example. Lessons that contain video will take longer to download because the files are bigger and in three different formats.

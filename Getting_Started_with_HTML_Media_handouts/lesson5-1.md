# Conclusion

That's it for this course! Thank you for your attention and patience.

Native audio and video playback in browsers brings new opportunities for web developers and for interactivity with the user. Its uses are not only limited to just regular playback in a page. Video and audio can be used in clever ways in web applications, games and much more.

What we saw here is just the start of a new world within web development. Also, with the advancement of specifications like WebVTT for subtitles and captions, and the fullscreen API we sure have an exciting future ahead of us.

I hope that you have learned something new here and as always keep studying, coding and learning more each day. Thank you again and until next time!

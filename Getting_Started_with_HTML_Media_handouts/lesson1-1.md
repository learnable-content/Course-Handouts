# Welcome

Hi and welcome to Getting Started with HTML Media course! My name is Guilherme Muller and I'm a web developer.

In HTML5, media has reached new horizons with the introduction of the `audio` and `video` tags, in conjunction with the `source` and `track`, which you'll see in detail later. These tags provide native means of embedding videos and sounds in a page, without us needing to resort to proprietary technologies like the Flash platform.

Another exciting development is the WebVTT file format, which can be used to add subtitles and more, increasing the accessibility of this kind of content.

This, and more, will be covered in this course.

# What You'll Learn

You will learn:

* How to work with `audio` and `video` tags, and how to customize it.
* How to convert video and audio files.
* How to use plugins to offer cross-browser support.
* How to use the WebVTT format to provide subtitles for videos.
* How to develop a custom media player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can play both audio and video.

# What You'll Need

You are going to need very basic software to take this course:

* A text editor of your choice (I'll be using Sublime Text)
* A browser, like Firefox or Chrome.

You can find links for the recommended software in the lesson notes.
